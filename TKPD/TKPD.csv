Active Token Mixer,"The three existing dominant network families, i.e., CNNs, Transformers, and
MLPs, differ from each other mainly in the ways of fusing spatial contextual
information, leaving designing more effective token-mixing mechanisms at the
core of backbone architecture development. In this work, we propose an
innovative token-mixer, dubbed Active Token Mixer (ATM), to actively
incorporate flexible contextual information distributed across different
channels from other tokens into the given query token. This fundamental
operator actively predicts where to capture useful contexts and learns how to
fuse the captured contexts with the query token at channel level. In this way,
the spatial range of token-mixing can be expanded to a global scope with
limited computational complexity, where the way of token-mixing is reformed. We
take ATM as the primary operator and assemble ATMs into a cascade architecture,
dubbed ATMNet. Extensive experiments demonstrate that ATMNet is generally
applicable and comprehensively surpasses different families of SOTA vision
backbones by a clear margin on a broad range of vision tasks, including visual
recognition and dense prediction tasks. Code is available at

Enhancing Multi-modal and Multi-hop Question Answering via Structured Knowledge and Unified Retrieval-Generation,"Multi-modal multi-hop question answering involves answering a question by
reasoning over multiple input sources from different modalities. Existing
methods often retrieve evidences separately and then use a language model to
generate an answer based on the retrieved evidences, and thus do not adequately
connect candidates and are unable to model the interdependent relations during
retrieval. Moreover, the pipelined approaches of retrieval and generation might
result in poor generation performance when retrieval performance is low. To
address these issues, we propose a Structured Knowledge and Unified
Retrieval-Generation (SKURG) approach. SKURG employs an Entity-centered Fusion
Encoder to align sources from different modalities using shared entities. It
then uses a unified Retrieval-Generation Decoder to integrate intermediate
retrieval results for answer generation and also adaptively determine the
number of retrieval steps. Extensive experiments on two representative
multi-modal multi-hop QA datasets MultimodalQA and WebQA demonstrate that SKURG
outperforms the state-of-the-art models in both source retrieval and answer
generation performance with fewer parameters. Our code is available at
https://github.com/HITsz-TMG/SKURG.",question answering,
Effective classification of ECG signals using enhanced convolutional neural network in IOT,"In this paper, a novel ECG monitoring approach based on IoT technology is
suggested. This paper proposes a routing system for IoT healthcare platforms
based on Dynamic Source Routing (DSR) and Routing by Energy and Link Quality
(REL). In addition, the Artificial Neural Network (ANN), Support Vector Machine
(SVM), and Convolution Neural Networks (CNNs)-based approaches for ECG signal
categorization were tested in this study. Deep-ECG will employ a deep CNN to
extract important characteristics, which will then be compared using simple and
fast distance functions in order to classify cardiac problems efficiently. This
work has suggested algorithms for the categorization of ECG data acquired from
mobile watch users in order to identify aberrant data. The Massachusetts
Institute of Technology (MIT) and Beth Israel Hospital (MIT/BIH) Arrhythmia
Database have been used for experimental verification of the suggested
approaches. The results show that the proposed strategy outperforms others in
terms of classification accuracy.",ECG signal classification,
Incentivizing Federated Learning,"Federated Learning is an emerging distributed collaborative learning paradigm
used by many of applications nowadays. The effectiveness of federated learning
relies on clients' collective efforts and their willingness to contribute local
data. However, due to privacy concerns and the costs of data collection and
model training, clients may not always contribute all the data they possess,
which would negatively affect the performance of the global model. This paper
presents an incentive mechanism that encourages clients to contribute as much
data as they can obtain. Unlike previous incentive mechanisms, our approach
does not monetize data. Instead, we implicitly use model performance as a
reward, i.e., significant contributors are paid off with better models. We
theoretically prove that clients will use as much data as they can possibly
possess to participate in federated learning under certain conditions with our
incentive mechanism",federated learning,
Roadmap to Autonomous Surgery -- A Framework to Surgical Autonomy,"Robotic surgery has increased the domain of surgeries possible. Several

discuss the current challenges and advances required to make this happen.",surgical automation,
Vision-and-Language Pretraining,"With the burgeoning amount of data of image-text pairs and diversity of
Vision-and-Language (V\&L) tasks, scholars have introduced an abundance of deep
learning models in this research domain. Furthermore, in recent years, transfer
learning has also shown tremendous success in Computer Vision for tasks such as
Image Classification, Object Detection, etc., and in Natural Language
Processing for Question Answering, Machine Translation, etc. Inheriting the
spirit of Transfer Learning, research works in V\&L have devised multiple
pretraining techniques on large-scale datasets in order to enhance the
performance of downstream tasks. The aim of this article is to provide a
comprehensive revision of contemporary V\&L pretraining models. In particular,
we categorize and delineate pretraining approaches, along with the summary of
state-of-the-art vision-and-language pretrained models. Moreover, a list of
training datasets and downstream tasks is supplied to further polish the
perspective into V\&L pretraining. Lastly, we decided to take a further step to
discuss numerous directions for future research.",vision-and-language pretraining,
Oracle-MNIST: a Dataset of Oracle Characters for Benchmarking Machine Learning Algorithms,"We introduce the Oracle-MNIST dataset, comprising of 28$\times $28 grayscale
images of 30,222 ancient characters from 10 categories, for benchmarking
pattern classification, with particular challenges on image noise and
distortion. The training set totally consists of 27,222 images, and the test
set contains 300 images per class. Oracle-MNIST shares the same data format
with the original MNIST dataset, allowing for direct compatibility with all
existing classifiers and systems, but it constitutes a more challenging
classification task than MNIST. The images of ancient characters suffer from 1)
extremely serious and unique noises caused by three-thousand years of burial
and aging and 2) dramatically variant writing styles by ancient Chinese, which
all make them realistic for machine learning research. The dataset is freely

Video Demoireing with Relation-Based Temporal Consistency,"Moire patterns, appearing as color distortions, severely degrade image and
video qualities when filming a screen with digital cameras. Considering the
increasing demands for capturing videos, we study how to remove such
undesirable moire patterns in videos, namely video demoireing. To this end, we
introduce the first hand-held video demoireing dataset with a dedicated data
collection pipeline to ensure spatial and temporal alignments of captured data.
Further, a baseline video demoireing model with implicit feature space
alignment and selective feature aggregation is developed to leverage
complementary information from nearby frames to improve frame-level video
demoireing. More importantly, we propose a relation-based temporal consistency
loss to encourage the model to learn temporal consistency priors directly from
ground-truth reference videos, which facilitates producing temporally
consistent predictions and effectively maintains frame-level qualities.
Extensive experiments manifest the superiority of our model. Code is available
at \url{https://daipengwa.github.io/VDmoire_ProjectPage/}.",video demoireing,
Causal Discovery and Knowledge Injection for Contestable Neural Networks (with Appendices),"Neural networks have proven to be effective at solving machine learning tasks
but it is unclear whether they learn any relevant causal relationships, while
their black-box nature makes it difficult for modellers to understand and debug
them. We propose a novel method overcoming these issues by allowing a two-way
interaction whereby neural-network-empowered machines can expose the
underpinning learnt causal graphs and humans can contest the machines by
modifying the causal graphs before re-injecting them into the machines. The
learnt models are guaranteed to conform to the graphs and adhere to expert
knowledge, some of which can also be given up-front. By building a window into
the model behaviour and enabling knowledge injection, our method allows
practitioners to debug networks based on the causal structure discovered from
the data and underpinning the predictions. Experiments with real and synthetic
tabular data show that our method improves predictive performance up to 2.4x
while producing parsimonious networks, up to 7x smaller in the input layer,
compared to SOTA regularised networks.",causal discovery,
Encoder-Decoder Network with Guided Transmission Map: Architecture,"An insight into the architecture of the Encoder-Decoder Network with Guided
Transmission Map (EDN-GTM), a novel and effective single image dehazing scheme,
is presented in this paper. The EDN-GTM takes a conventional RGB hazy image in
conjunction with the corresponding transmission map estimated by the dark
channel prior (DCP) approach as inputs of the network. The EDN-GTM adopts an
enhanced structure of U-Net developed for dehazing tasks and the resulting
EDN-GDM has shown state-of-the-art performances on benchmark dehazing datasets
in terms of PSNR and SSIM metrics. In order to give an in-depth understanding
of the well-designed architecture which largely contributes to the success of
the EDN-GTM, extensive experiments and analysis from selecting the core
structure of the scheme to investigating advanced network designs are presented
in this paper.",image dehazing,
CAPSTONE: Curriculum Sampling for Dense Retrieval with Document Expansion,"The dual-encoder has become the de facto architecture for dense retrieval.
Typically, it computes the latent representations of the query and document
independently, thus failing to fully capture the interactions between the query
and document. To alleviate this, recent research has focused on obtaining
query-informed document representations. During training, it expands the
document with a real query, but during inference, it replaces the real query
with a generated one. This inconsistency between training and inference causes
the dense retrieval model to prioritize query information while disregarding
the document when computing the document representation. Consequently, it
performs even worse than the vanilla dense retrieval model because its
performance heavily relies on the relevance between the generated queries and
the real query.In this paper, we propose a curriculum sampling strategy that
utilizes pseudo queries during training and progressively enhances the
relevance between the generated query and the real query. By doing so, the
retrieval model learns to extend its attention from the document alone to both
the document and query, resulting in high-quality query-informed document
representations. Experimental results on both in-domain and out-of-domain
datasets demonstrate that our approach outperforms previous dense retrieval
models.",dense retrieval,
Attack-Agnostic Adversarial Detection,"The growing number of adversarial attacks in recent years gives attackers an
advantage over defenders, as defenders must train detectors after knowing the
types of attacks, and many models need to be maintained to ensure good
performance in detecting any upcoming attacks. We propose a way to end the
tug-of-war between attackers and defenders by treating adversarial attack
detection as an anomaly detection problem so that the detector is agnostic to
the attack. We quantify the statistical deviation caused by adversarial
perturbations in two aspects. The Least Significant Component Feature (LSCF)
quantifies the deviation of adversarial examples from the statistics of benign
samples and Hessian Feature (HF) reflects how adversarial examples distort the
landscape of the model's optima by measuring the local loss curvature.
Empirical results show that our method can achieve an overall ROC AUC of 94.9%,
89.7%, and 94.6% on CIFAR10, CIFAR100, and SVHN, respectively, and has
comparable performance to adversarial detectors trained with adversarial
examples on most of the attacks.",adversarial attack detection,
Addressing Gap between Training Data and Deployed Environment by On-Device Learning,"The accuracy of tinyML applications is often affected by various
environmental factors, such as noises, location/calibration of sensors, and
time-related changes. This article introduces a neural network based on-device
learning (ODL) approach to address this issue by retraining in deployed
environments. Our approach relies on semi-supervised sequential training of
multiple neural networks tailored for low-end edge devices. This article
introduces its algorithm and implementation on wireless sensor nodes consisting
of a Raspberry Pi Pico and low-power wireless module. Experiments using
vibration patterns of rotating machines demonstrate that retraining by ODL
improves anomaly detection accuracy compared with a prediction-only deep neural
network in a noisy environment. The results also show that the ODL approach can
save communication cost and energy consumption for battery-powered Internet of
Things devices.",on-device learning,
LSCDiscovery: A shared task on semantic change discovery and detection in Spanish,"We present the first shared task on semantic change discovery and detection
in Spanish and create the first dataset of Spanish words manually annotated for
semantic change using the DURel framework (Schlechtweg et al., 2018). The task
is divided in two phases: 1) Graded Change Discovery, and 2) Binary Change
Detection. In addition to introducing a new language the main novelty with
respect to the previous tasks consists in predicting and evaluating changes for
all vocabulary words in the corpus. Six teams participated in phase 1 and seven
teams in phase 2 of the shared task, and the best system obtained a Spearman
rank correlation of 0.735 for phase 1 and an F1 score of 0.716 for phase 2. We
describe the systems developed by the competing teams, highlighting the
techniques that were particularly useful and discuss the limits of these
approaches.",semantic change detection,
MotionDeltaCNN: Sparse CNN Inference of Frame Differences in Moving Camera Videos,"Convolutional neural network inference on video input is computationally
expensive and requires high memory bandwidth. Recently, DeltaCNN managed to
reduce the cost by only processing pixels with significant updates over the
previous frame. However, DeltaCNN relies on static camera input. Moving cameras
add new challenges in how to fuse newly unveiled image regions with already
processed regions efficiently to minimize the update rate - without increasing
memory overhead and without knowing the camera extrinsics of future frames. In
this work, we propose MotionDeltaCNN, a sparse CNN inference framework that
supports moving cameras. We introduce spherical buffers and padded convolutions
to enable seamless fusion of newly unveiled regions and previously processed
regions -- without increasing memory footprint. Our evaluation shows that we
outperform DeltaCNN by up to 90% for moving camera videos.",sparse CNN inference,
Power Bundle Adjustment for Large-Scale 3D Reconstruction,"We introduce Power Bundle Adjustment as an expansion type algorithm for
solving large-scale bundle adjustment problems. It is based on the power series
expansion of the inverse Schur complement and constitutes a new family of
solvers that we call inverse expansion methods. We theoretically justify the
use of power series and we prove the convergence of our approach. Using the
real-world BAL dataset we show that the proposed solver challenges the
state-of-the-art iterative methods and significantly accelerates the solution
of the normal equation, even for reaching a very high accuracy. This
easy-to-implement solver can also complement a recently presented distributed
bundle adjustment framework. We demonstrate that employing the proposed Power
Bundle Adjustment as a sub-problem solver significantly improves speed and
accuracy of the distributed optimization.",large-scale 3D reconstruction,
Exploring Cross-lingual Textual Style Transfer with Large Multilingual Language Models,"Detoxification is a task of generating text in polite style while preserving
meaning and fluency of the original toxic text. Existing detoxification methods
are designed to work in one exact language. This work investigates multilingual
and cross-lingual detoxification and the behavior of large multilingual models
like in this setting. Unlike previous works we aim to make large language
models able to perform detoxification without direct fine-tuning in given
language. Experiments show that multilingual models are capable of performing
multilingual style transfer. However, models are not able to perform
cross-lingual detoxification and direct fine-tuning on exact language is
inevitable.",cross-lingual detoxification,
Modular Domain Adaptation,"Off-the-shelf models are widely used by computational social science
researchers to measure properties of text, such as sentiment. However, without
access to source data it is difficult to account for domain shift, which
represents a threat to validity. Here, we treat domain adaptation as a modular
process that involves separate model producers and model consumers, and show
how they can independently cooperate to facilitate more accurate measurements
of text. We introduce two lightweight techniques for this scenario, and
demonstrate that they reliably increase out-of-domain accuracy on four
multi-domain text classification datasets when used with linear and contextual
embedding models. We conclude with recommendations for model producers and
consumers, and release models and replication code to accompany this paper.",Domain Adaptation Text Classification,

"C$^3$Fusion: Consistent Contrastive Colon Fusion, Towards Deep SLAM in Colonoscopy","3D colon reconstruction from Optical Colonoscopy (OC) to detect non-examined
surfaces remains an unsolved problem. The challenges arise from the nature of
optical colonoscopy data, characterized by highly reflective low-texture
surfaces, drastic illumination changes and frequent tracking loss. Recent
methods demonstrate compelling results, but suffer from: (1) frangible
frame-to-frame (or frame-to-model) pose estimation resulting in many tracking
failures; or (2) rely on point-based representations at the cost of scan
quality. In this paper, we propose a novel reconstruction framework that
addresses these issues end to end, which result in both quantitatively and
qualitatively accurate and robust 3D colon reconstruction. Our SLAM approach,
which employs correspondences based on contrastive deep features, and deep
consistent depth maps, estimates globally optimized poses, is able to recover
from frequent tracking failures, and estimates a global consistent 3D model;
all within a single framework. We perform an extensive experimental evaluation
on multiple synthetic and real colonoscopy videos, showing high-quality results
and comparisons against relevant baselines.",3D colon reconstruction,
LatentKeypointGAN: Controlling Images via Latent Keypoints -- Extended Abstract,"Generative adversarial networks (GANs) can now generate photo-realistic
images. However, how to best control the image content remains an open
challenge. We introduce LatentKeypointGAN, a two-stage GAN internally
conditioned on a set of keypoints and associated appearance embeddings
providing control of the position and style of the generated objects and their
respective parts. A major difficulty that we address is disentangling the image
into spatial and appearance factors with little domain knowledge and
supervision signals. We demonstrate in a user study and quantitative
experiments that LatentKeypointGAN provides an interpretable latent space that
can be used to re-arrange the generated images by re-positioning and exchanging
keypoint embeddings, such as generating portraits by combining the eyes, and
mouth from different images. Notably, our method does not require labels as it
is self-supervised and thereby applies to diverse application domains, such as
editing portraits, indoor rooms, and full-body human poses.",Generative adversarial network,
Planning with Spatial-Temporal Abstraction from Point Clouds for Deformable Object Manipulation,"Effective planning of long-horizon deformable object manipulation requires
suitable abstractions at both the spatial and temporal levels. Previous methods
typically either focus on short-horizon tasks or make strong assumptions that
full-state information is available, which prevents their use on deformable
objects. In this paper, we propose PlAnning with Spatial-Temporal Abstraction
(PASTA), which incorporates both spatial abstraction (reasoning about objects
and their relations to each other) and temporal abstraction (reasoning over
skills instead of low-level actions). Our framework maps high-dimension 3D
observations such as point clouds into a set of latent vectors and plans over
skill sequences on top of the latent set representation. We show that our
method can effectively perform challenging sequential deformable object
manipulation tasks in the real world, which require combining multiple tool-use
skills such as cutting with a knife, pushing with a pusher, and spreading the
dough with a roller.",deformable object manipulation,
1st Place Solution of The Robust Vision Challenge 2022 Semantic Segmentation Track,"This report describes the winning solution to the Robust Vision Challenge
(RVC) semantic segmentation track at ECCV 2022. Our method adopts the

from 9 datasets (ADE20K, Cityscapes, Mapillary Vistas, ScanNet, VIPER, WildDash
2, IDD, BDD, and COCO) with a simple dataset balancing strategy. All the
original labels are projected to a 256-class unified label space, and the model
is trained using a cross-entropy loss. Without significant hyperparameter
tuning or any specific loss weighting, our solution ranks the first place on
all the testing semantic segmentation benchmarks from multiple domains (ADE20K,
Cityscapes, Mapillary Vistas, ScanNet, VIPER, and WildDash 2). The proposed

Oracles & Followers: Stackelberg Equilibria in Deep Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning,"Stackelberg equilibria arise naturally in a range of popular learning
problems, such as in security games or indirect mechanism design, and have
received increasing attention in the reinforcement learning literature. We
present a general framework for implementing Stackelberg equilibria search as a
multi-agent RL problem, allowing a wide range of algorithmic design choices. We
discuss how previous approaches can be seen as specific instantiations of this
framework. As a key insight, we note that the design space allows for
approaches not previously seen in the literature, for instance by leveraging
multitask and meta-RL techniques for follower convergence. We propose one such
approach using contextual policies, and evaluate it experimentally on both
standard and novel benchmark domains, showing greatly improved sample
efficiency compared to previous approaches. Finally, we explore the effect of
adopting algorithm designs outside the borders of our framework.",Stackelberg equilibria search,
Randomized Smoothing under Attack: How Good is it in Pratice?,"Randomized smoothing is a recent and celebrated solution to certify the
robustness of any classifier. While it indeed provides a theoretical robustness
against adversarial attacks, the dimensionality of current classifiers
necessarily imposes Monte Carlo approaches for its application in practice.
This paper questions the effectiveness of randomized smoothing as a defense,
against state of the art black-box attacks. This is a novel perspective, as
previous research works considered the certification as an unquestionable
guarantee. We first formally highlight the mismatch between a theoretical
certification and the practice of attacks on classifiers. We then perform
attacks on randomized smoothing as a defense. Our main observation is that
there is a major mismatch in the settings of the RS for obtaining high
certified robustness or when defeating black box attacks while preserving the
classifier accuracy.",Randomized Smoothing Defense,
Generating Full Length Wikipedia Biographies: The Impact of Gender Bias on the Retrieval-Based Generation of Women Biographies,"Generating factual, long-form text such as Wikipedia articles raises three
key challenges: how to gather relevant evidence, how to structure information
into well-formed text, and how to ensure that the generated text is factually
correct. We address these by developing a model for English text that uses a
retrieval mechanism to identify relevant supporting information on the web and
a cache-based pre-trained encoder-decoder to generate long-form biographies
section by section, including citation information. To assess the impact of
available web evidence on the output text, we compare the performance of our
approach when generating biographies about women (for which less information is
available on the web) vs. biographies generally. To this end, we curate a
dataset of 1,500 biographies about women. We analyze our generated text to
understand how differences in available web evidence data affect generation. We
evaluate the factuality, fluency, and quality of the generated texts using
automatic metrics and human evaluation. We hope that these techniques can be
used as a starting point for human writers, to aid in reducing the complexity
inherent in the creation of long-form, factual text.",long-form text generation,
Keep Your Friends Close & Enemies Farther: Debiasing Contrastive Learning with Spatial Priors in 3D Radiology Images,"Understanding of spatial attributes is central to effective 3D radiology
image analysis where crop-based learning is the de facto standard. Given an
image patch, its core spatial properties (e.g., position & orientation) provide
helpful priors on expected object sizes, appearances, and structures through
inherent anatomical consistencies. Spatial correspondences, in particular, can
effectively gauge semantic similarities between inter-image regions, while
their approximate extraction requires no annotations or overbearing
computational costs. However, recent 3D contrastive learning approaches either
neglect correspondences or fail to maximally capitalize on them. To this end,
we propose an extensible 3D contrastive framework (Spade, for Spatial
Debiasing) that leverages extracted correspondences to select more effective
positive & negative samples for representation learning. Our method learns both
globally invariant and locally equivariant representations with downstream
segmentation in mind. We also propose separate selection strategies for global
& local scopes that tailor to their respective representational requirements.
Compared to recent state-of-the-art approaches, Spade shows notable
improvements on three downstream segmentation tasks (CT Abdominal Organ, CT
Heart, MR Heart).", 3D contrastive learning,
Euler State Networks: Non-dissipative Reservoir Computing,"Inspired by the numerical solution of ordinary differential equations, in
this paper we propose a novel Reservoir Computing (RC) model, called the Euler
State Network (EuSN). The presented approach makes use of forward Euler
discretization and antisymmetric recurrent matrices to design reservoir
dynamics that are both stable and non-dissipative by construction.
  Our mathematical analysis shows that the resulting model is biased towards a
unitary effective spectral radius and zero local Lyapunov exponents,
intrinsically operating near to the edge of stability. Experiments on long-term
memory tasks show the clear superiority of the proposed approach over standard
RC models in problems requiring effective propagation of input information over
multiple time-steps. Furthermore, results on time-series classification
benchmarks indicate that EuSN is able to match (or even exceed) the accuracy of
trainable Recurrent Neural Networks, while retaining the training efficiency of
the RC family, resulting in up to $\approx$ 490-fold savings in computation
time and $\approx$ 1750-fold savings in energy consumption.",Reservoir Computing,
Improving Pre-trained Language Model Fine-tuning with Noise Stability Regularization,"The advent of large-scale pre-trained language models has contributed greatly
to the recent progress in natural language processing. Many state-of-the-art
language models are first trained on a large text corpus and then fine-tuned on
downstream tasks. Despite its recent success and wide adoption, fine-tuning a
pre-trained language model often suffers from overfitting, which leads to poor
generalizability due to the extremely high complexity of the model and the
limited training samples from downstream tasks. To address this problem, we
propose a novel and effective fine-tuning framework, named Layerwise Noise
Stability Regularization (LNSR). Specifically, we propose to inject the
standard Gaussian noise or In-manifold noise and regularize hidden
representations of the fine-tuned model. We first provide theoretical analyses
to support the efficacy of our method. We then demonstrate the advantages of
the proposed method over other state-of-the-art algorithms including L2-SP,
Mixout and SMART. While these previous works only verify the effectiveness of
their methods on relatively simple text classification tasks, we also verify
the effectiveness of our method on question answering tasks, where the target
problem is much more difficult and more training examples are available.
Furthermore, extensive experimental results indicate that the proposed
algorithm can not only enhance the in-domain performance of the language models
but also improve the domain generalization performance on out-of-domain data.",Language Model Fine-tuning,
Revisiting L1 Loss in Super-Resolution: A Probabilistic View and Beyond,"Super-resolution as an ill-posed problem has many high-resolution candidates
for a low-resolution input. However, the popular $\ell_1$ loss used to best fit
the given HR image fails to consider this fundamental property of
non-uniqueness in image restoration. In this work, we fix the missing piece in
$\ell_1$ loss by formulating super-resolution with neural networks as a
probabilistic model. It shows that $\ell_1$ loss is equivalent to a degraded
likelihood function that removes the randomness from the learning process. By
introducing a data-adaptive random variable, we present a new objective
function that aims at minimizing the expectation of the reconstruction error
over all plausible solutions. The experimental results show consistent
improvements on mainstream architectures, with no extra parameter or computing
cost at inference time.",Super-Resolution,
Neural Mesh-Based Graphics,"We revisit NPBG, the popular approach to novel view synthesis that introduced

addition to a foreground/background scene rendering split, and an improved
loss. By training solely on a single scene, we outperform NPBG, which has been
trained on ScanNet and then scene finetuned. We also perform competitively with
respect to the state-of-the-art method SVS, which has been trained on the full

Applicability limitations of differentiable full-reference image-quality,"Subjective image-quality measurement plays a critical role in the development
of image-processing applications. The purpose of a visual-quality metric is to
approximate the results of subjective assessment. In this regard, more and more
metrics are under development, but little research has considered their
limitations. This paper addresses that deficiency: we show how image
preprocessing before compression can artificially increase the quality scores
provided by the popular metrics DISTS, LPIPS, HaarPSI, and VIF as well as how
these scores are inconsistent with subjective-quality scores. We propose a
series of neural-network preprocessing models that increase DISTS by up to
34.5%, LPIPS by up to 36.8%, VIF by up to 98.0%, and HaarPSI by up to 22.6% in
the case of JPEG-compressed images. A subjective comparison of preprocessed
images showed that for most of the metrics we examined, visual quality drops or
stays unchanged, limiting the applicability of these metrics.",visual-quality metric,
Team Yao at Factify 2022: Utilizing Pre-trained Models and Co-attention Networks for Multi-Modal Fact Verification,"In recent years, social media has enabled users to get exposed to a myriad of
misinformation and disinformation; thus, misinformation has attracted a great
deal of attention in research fields and as a social issue. To address the
problem, we propose a framework, Pre-CoFact, composed of two pre-trained models
for extracting features from text and images, and multiple co-attention
networks for fusing the same modality but different sources and different
modalities. Besides, we adopt the ensemble method by using different
pre-trained models in Pre-CoFact to achieve better performance. We further
illustrate the effectiveness from the ablation study and examine different
pre-trained models for comparison. Our team, Yao, won the fifth prize
(F1-score: 74.585\%) in the Factify challenge hosted by De-Factify @ AAAI 2022,

Compose & Embellish: Well-Structured Piano Performance Generation via A Two-Stage Approach,"Even with strong sequence models like Transformers, generating expressive
piano performances with long-range musical structures remains challenging.
Meanwhile, methods to compose well-structured melodies or lead sheets (melody +

above, we devise a two-stage Transformer-based framework that Composes a lead
sheet first, and then Embellishes it with accompaniment and expressive touches.
Such a factorization also enables pretraining on non-piano data. Our objective
and subjective experiments show that Compose & Embellish shrinks the gap in

and improves other musical aspects such as richness and coherence as well.",Music Generation,
Focus-Driven Contrastive Learniang for Medical Question Summarization,"Automatic medical question summarization can significantly help the system to
understand consumer health questions and retrieve correct answers. The Seq2Seq

task, which faces two general problems: the model can not capture well question
focus and and the traditional MLE strategy lacks the ability to understand
sentence-level semantics. To alleviate these problems, we propose a novel
question focus-driven contrastive learning framework (QFCL). Specially, we
propose an easy and effective approach to generate hard negative samples based
on the question focus, and exploit contrastive learning at both encoder and
decoder to obtain better sentence level representations. On three medical
benchmark datasets, our proposed model achieves new state-of-the-art results,
and obtains a performance gain of 5.33, 12.85 and 3.81 points over the baseline

analysis prove that our QFCL model learns better sentence representations with
the ability to distinguish different sentence meanings, and generates

Using Natural Sentences for Understanding Biases in Language Models,"Evaluation of biases in language models is often limited to synthetically
generated datasets. This dependence traces back to the need for a prompt-style
dataset to trigger specific behaviors of language models. In this paper, we
address this gap by creating a prompt dataset with respect to occupations
collected from real-world natural sentences present in Wikipedia. We aim to
understand the differences between using template-based prompts and natural
sentence prompts when studying gender-occupation biases in language models. We
find bias evaluations are very sensitive to the design choices of template
prompts, and we propose using natural sentence prompts for systematic
evaluations to step away from design choices that could introduce bias in the
observations.",Language Models Biases,
Multi Document Reading Comprehension,"Reading Comprehension (RC) is a task of answering a question from a given
passage or a set of passages. In the case of multiple passages, the task is to
find the best possible answer to the question. Recent trials and experiments in
the field of Natural Language Processing (NLP) have proved that machines can be
provided with the ability to not only process the text in the passage and
understand its meaning to answer the question from the passage, but also can
surpass the Human Performance on many datasets such as Standford's Question
Answering Dataset (SQuAD). This paper presents a study on Reading Comprehension
and its evolution in Natural Language Processing over the past few decades. We
shall also study how the task of Single Document Reading Comprehension acts as
a building block for our Multi-Document Reading Comprehension System. In the
latter half of the paper, we'll be studying about a recently proposed model for
Multi-Document Reading Comprehension - RE3QA that is comprised of a Reader,
Retriever, and a Re-ranker based network to fetch the best possible answer from
a given set of passages.",document reading comprehension,
Vega-MT: The JD Explore Academy Translation System for WMT22,"We describe the JD Explore Academy's submission of the WMT 2022 shared
general translation task. We participated in all high-resource tracks and one
medium-resource track, including Chinese-English, German-English,
Czech-English, Russian-English, and Japanese-English. We push the limit of our
previous work -- bidirectional training for translation by scaling up two main
factors, i.e. language pairs and model sizes, namely the \textbf{Vega-MT}
system. As for language pairs, we scale the ""bidirectional"" up to the
""multidirectional"" settings, covering all participating languages, to exploit
the common knowledge across languages, and transfer them to the downstream
bilingual tasks. As for model sizes, we scale the Transformer-Big up to the
extremely large model that owns nearly 4.7 Billion parameters, to fully enhance
the model capacity for our Vega-MT. Also, we adopt the data augmentation
strategies, e.g. cycle translation for monolingual data, and bidirectional
self-training for bilingual and monolingual data, to comprehensively exploit
the bilingual and monolingual data. To adapt our Vega-MT to the general domain
test set, generalization tuning is designed. Based on the official automatic
scores of constrained systems, in terms of the sacreBLEU shown in Figure-1, we
got the 1st place on {Zh-En (33.5), En-Zh (49.7), De-En (33.7), En-De (37.8),
Cs-En (54.9), En-Cs (41.4) and En-Ru (32.7)}, 2nd place on {Ru-En (45.1) and

Generic and Trend-aware Curriculum Learning for Relation Extraction in Graph Neural Networks,"We present a generic and trend-aware curriculum learning approach for graph
neural networks. It extends existing approaches by incorporating sample-level
loss trends to better discriminate easier from harder samples and schedule them
for training. The model effectively integrates textual and structural
information for relation extraction in text graphs. Experimental results show
that the model provides robust estimations of sample difficulty and shows
sizable improvement over the state-of-the-art approaches across several
datasets.",relation extraction,
Too Brittle To Touch: Comparing the Stability of Quantization and Distillation Towards Developing Lightweight Low-Resource MT Models,"Leveraging shared learning through Massively Multilingual Models,
state-of-the-art machine translation models are often able to adapt to the
paucity of data for low-resource languages. However, this performance comes at
the cost of significantly bloated models which are not practically deployable.
Knowledge Distillation is one popular technique to develop competitive,
lightweight models: In this work, we first evaluate its use to compress MT
models focusing on languages with extremely limited training data. Through our
analysis across 8 languages, we find that the variance in the performance of
the distilled models due to their dependence on priors including the amount of
synthetic data used for distillation, the student architecture, training
hyperparameters and confidence of the teacher models, makes distillation a
brittle compression mechanism. To mitigate this, we explore the use of
post-training quantization for the compression of these models. Here, we find
that while distillation provides gains across some low-resource languages,
quantization provides more consistent performance trends for the entire range
of languages, especially the lowest-resource languages in our target set.",low-resource machine translation,
Is explainable AI a race against model complexity?,"Explaining the behaviour of intelligent systems will get increasingly and
perhaps intractably challenging as models grow in size and complexity. We may
not be able to expect an explanation for every prediction made by a brain-scale
model, nor can we expect explanations to remain objective or apolitical. Our
functionalist understanding of these models is of less advantage than we might
assume. Models precede explanations, and can be useful even when both model and
explanation are incorrect. Explainability may never win the race against
complexity, but this is less problematic than it seems.",explainable AI,
Learning Compositional Representations for Effective Low-Shot Generalization,"We propose Recognition as Part Composition (RPC), an image encoding approach
inspired by human cognition. It is based on the cognitive theory that humans
recognize complex objects by components, and that they build a small compact
vocabulary of concepts to represent each instance with. RPC encodes images by
first decomposing them into salient parts, and then encoding each part as a
mixture of a small number of prototypes, each representing a certain concept.
We find that this type of learning inspired by human cognition can overcome
hurdles faced by deep convolutional networks in low-shot generalization tasks,
like zero-shot learning, few-shot learning and unsupervised domain adaptation.
Furthermore, we find a classifier using an RPC image encoder is fairly robust
to adversarial attacks, that deep neural networks are known to be prone to.
Given that our image encoding principle is based on human cognition, one would
expect the encodings to be interpretable by humans, which we find to be the
case via crowd-sourcing experiments. Finally, we propose an application of
these interpretable encodings in the form of generating synthetic attribute
annotations for evaluating zero-shot learning methods on new datasets.",Low-Shot Generalization,
SNeRF: Stylized Neural Implicit Representations for 3D Scenes,"This paper presents a stylized novel view synthesis method. Applying
state-of-the-art stylization methods to novel views frame by frame often causes
jittering artifacts due to the lack of cross-view consistency. Therefore, this
paper investigates 3D scene stylization that provides a strong inductive bias
for consistent novel view synthesis. Specifically, we adopt the emerging neural
radiance fields (NeRF) as our choice of 3D scene representation for their
capability to render high-quality novel views for a variety of scenes. However,
as rendering a novel view from a NeRF requires a large number of samples,
training a stylized NeRF requires a large amount of GPU memory that goes beyond
an off-the-shelf GPU capacity. We introduce a new training method to address
this problem by alternating the NeRF and stylization optimization steps. Such a
method enables us to make full use of our hardware memory capacity to both
generate images at higher resolution and adopt more expressive image style
transfer methods. Our experiments show that our method produces stylized NeRFs
for a wide range of content, including indoor, outdoor and dynamic scenes, and
synthesizes high-quality novel views with cross-view consistency.",3D scene stylization,
Atlas: Few-shot Learning with Retrieval Augmented Language Models,"Large language models have shown impressive few-shot results on a wide range
of tasks. However, when knowledge is key for such results, as is the case for
tasks such as question answering and fact checking, massive parameter counts to
store knowledge seem to be needed. Retrieval augmented models are known to
excel at knowledge intensive tasks without the need for as many parameters, but
it is unclear whether they work in few-shot settings. In this work we present
Atlas, a carefully designed and pre-trained retrieval augmented language model
able to learn knowledge intensive tasks with very few training examples. We
perform evaluations on a wide range of tasks, including MMLU, KILT and
NaturalQuestions, and study the impact of the content of the document index,
showing that it can easily be updated. Notably, Atlas reaches over 42% accuracy
on Natural Questions using only 64 examples, outperforming a 540B parameters
model by 3% despite having 50x fewer parameters.",Retrieval-Augmented Generation,
Bridging Cross-Lingual Gaps During Leveraging the Multilingual Sequence-to-Sequence Pretraining for Text Generation and Understanding,"For multilingual sequence-to-sequence pretrained language models
(multilingual Seq2Seq PLMs), e.g. mBART, the self-supervised pretraining task
is trained on a wide range of monolingual languages, e.g. 25 languages from
CommonCrawl, while the downstream cross-lingual tasks generally progress on a
bilingual language subset, e.g. English-German, making there exists the data
discrepancy, namely domain discrepancy, and cross-lingual learning objective
discrepancy, namely task discrepancy, between the pretraining and finetuning
stages. To bridge the above cross-lingual domain and task gaps, we extend the
vanilla pretrain-finetune pipeline with extra code-switching restore task.
Specifically, the first stage employs the self-supervised code-switching
restore task as a pretext task, allowing the multilingual Seq2Seq PLMs to
acquire some in-domain alignment information. And for the second stage, we
fine-tune the model on downstream data normally. Experiments on both NLG
evaluation (12 bilingual translation tasks, 30 zero-shot translation tasks, and
2 cross-lingual summarization tasks) and NLU evaluation (7 cross-lingual
natural language inference tasks) show our model outperforms the strong
baseline mBART with standard finetuning strategy, consistently. Analyses
indicate our approach could narrow the Euclidean distance of cross-lingual
sentence representations, and improve the model generalization with trivial
computational cost. We release the code at:

How Large Language Models are Transforming Machine-Paraphrased Plagiarism,"The recent success of large language models for text generation poses a
severe threat to academic integrity, as plagiarists can generate realistic
paraphrases indistinguishable from original work. However, the role of large
autoregressive transformers in generating machine-paraphrased plagiarism and
their detection is still developing in the literature. This work explores T5
and GPT-3 for machine-paraphrase generation on scientific articles from arXiv,
student theses, and Wikipedia. We evaluate the detection performance of six
automated solutions and one commercial plagiarism detection software and
perform a human study with 105 participants regarding their detection
performance and the quality of generated examples. Our results suggest that
large models can rewrite text humans have difficulty identifying as
machine-paraphrased (53% mean acc.). Human experts rate the quality of
paraphrases generated by GPT-3 as high as original texts (clarity 4.0/5,
fluency 4.2/5, coherence 3.8/5). The best-performing detection model (GPT-3)
achieves a 66% F1-score in detecting paraphrases.",machine-paraphrased plagiarism detection,
UniSAr: A Unified Structure-Aware Autoregressive Language Model for Text-to-SQL,"Existing text-to-SQL semantic parsers are typically designed for particular
settings such as handling queries that span multiple tables, domains or turns
which makes them ineffective when applied to different settings. We present
UniSAr (Unified Structure-Aware Autoregressive Language Model), which benefits
from directly using an off-the-shelf language model architecture and
demonstrates consistently high performance under different settings.
Specifically, UniSAr extends existing autoregressive language models to
incorporate three non-invasive extensions to make them structure-aware: (1)
adding structure mark to encode database schema, conversation context, and
their relationships; (2) constrained decoding to decode well structured SQL for
a given database schema; and (3) SQL completion to complete potential missing
JOIN relationships in SQL based on database schema. On seven well-known
text-to-SQL datasets covering multi-domain, multi-table and multi-turn, UniSAr
demonstrates highly comparable or better performance to the most advanced
specifically-designed text-to-SQL models. Importantly, our UniSAr is
non-invasive, such that other core model advances in text-to-SQL can also adopt
our extensions to further enhance performance.",text-to-SQL,
Contextualized language models for semantic change detection: lessons learned,"We present a qualitative analysis of the (potentially erroneous) outputs of
contextualized embedding-based methods for detecting diachronic semantic
change. First, we introduce an ensemble method outperforming previously
described contextualized approaches. This method is used as a basis for an
in-depth analysis of the degrees of semantic change predicted for English words
across 5 decades. Our findings show that contextualized methods can often
predict high change scores for words which are not undergoing any real
diachronic semantic shift in the lexicographic sense of the term (or at least
the status of these shifts is questionable). Such challenging cases are
discussed in detail with examples, and their linguistic categorization is
proposed. Our conclusion is that pre-trained contextualized language models are
prone to confound changes in lexicographic senses and changes in contextual
variance, which naturally stem from their distributional nature, but is
different from the types of issues observed in methods based on static
embeddings. Additionally, they often merge together syntactic and semantic
aspects of lexical entities. We propose a range of possible future solutions to
these issues.",semantic change detection,
Enhanced Knowledge Selection for Grounded Dialogues via Document Semantic Graphs,"Providing conversation models with background knowledge has been shown to
make open-domain dialogues more informative and engaging. Existing models treat
knowledge selection as a sentence ranking or classification problem where each
sentence is handled individually, ignoring the internal semantic connection
among sentences in the background document. In this work, we propose to
automatically convert the background knowledge documents into document semantic
graphs and then perform knowledge selection over such graphs. Our document
semantic graphs preserve sentence-level information through the use of sentence
nodes and provide concept connections between sentences. We jointly apply
multi-task learning for sentence-level and concept-level knowledge selection
and show that it improves sentence-level selection. Our experiments show that
our semantic graph-based knowledge selection improves over sentence selection
baselines for both the knowledge selection task and the end-to-end response
generation task on HollE and improves generalization on unseen topics in WoW.",Knowledge Grounded Dialogue,

AdaEnlight: Energy-aware Low-light Video Stream Enhancement on Mobile Devices,"The ubiquity of camera-embedded devices and the advances in deep learning
have stimulated various intelligent mobile video applications. These
applications often demand on-device processing of video streams to deliver
real-time, high-quality services for privacy and robustness concerns. However,
the performance of these applications is constrained by the raw video streams,
which tend to be taken with small-aperture cameras of ubiquitous mobile
platforms in dim light. Despite extensive low-light video enhancement
solutions, they are unfit for deployment to mobile devices due to their complex
models and and ignorance of system dynamics like energy budgets. In this paper,
we propose AdaEnlight, an energy-aware low-light video stream enhancement
system on mobile devices. It achieves real-time video enhancement with
competitive visual quality while allowing runtime behavior adaptation to the

diverse datasets, scenarios, and platforms and demonstrate the superiority of

solutions.",low-light video enhancement,
Unsupervised Extractive Summarization with Heterogeneous Graph Embeddings for Chinese Document,"In the scenario of unsupervised extractive summarization, learning
high-quality sentence representations is essential to select salient sentences
from the input document. Previous studies focus more on employing statistical
approaches or pre-trained language models (PLMs) to extract sentence
embeddings, while ignoring the rich information inherent in the heterogeneous
types of interaction between words and sentences. In this paper, we are the
first to propose an unsupervised extractive summarizaiton method with
heterogeneous graph embeddings (HGEs) for Chinese document. A heterogeneous
text graph is constructed to capture different granularities of interactions by
incorporating graph structural information. Moreover, our proposed graph is
general and flexible where additional nodes such as keywords can be easily
integrated. Experimental results demonstrate that our method consistently
outperforms the strong baseline in three summarization datasets.",Extractive Summarization,
Unsupervised Severely Deformed Mesh Reconstruction (DMR) from a Single-View Image,"Much progress has been made in the supervised learning of 3D reconstruction
of rigid objects from multi-view images or a video. However, it is more
challenging to reconstruct severely deformed objects from a single-view RGB
image in an unsupervised manner. Although training-based methods, such as
specific category-level training, have been shown to successfully reconstruct
rigid objects and slightly deformed objects like birds from a single-view
image, they cannot effectively handle severely deformed objects and neither can
be applied to some downstream tasks in the real world due to the inconsistent
semantic meaning of vertices, which are crucial in defining the adopted 3D
templates of objects to be reconstructed. In this work, we introduce a
template-based method to infer 3D shapes from a single-view image and apply the
reconstructed mesh to a downstream task, i.e., absolute length measurement.
Without using 3D ground truth, our method faithfully reconstructs 3D meshes and
achieves state-of-the-art accuracy in a length measurement task on a severely
deformed fish dataset.",3D reconstruction,
Memory-based Message Passing: Decoupling the Message for Propogation from Discrimination,"Message passing is a fundamental procedure for graph neural networks in the
field of graph representation learning. Based on the homophily assumption, the
current message passing always aggregates features of connected nodes, such as
the graph Laplacian smoothing process. However, real-world graphs tend to be
noisy and/or non-smooth. The homophily assumption does not always hold, leading
to sub-optimal results. A revised message passing method needs to maintain each
node's discriminative ability when aggregating the message from neighbors. To
this end, we propose a Memory-based Message Passing (MMP) method to decouple
the message of each node into a self-embedding part for discrimination and a
memory part for propagation. Furthermore, we develop a control mechanism and a
decoupling regularization to control the ratio of absorbing and excluding the
message in the memory for each node. More importantly, our MMP is a general
skill that can work as an additional layer to help improve traditional GNNs
performance. Extensive experiments on various datasets with different homophily
ratios demonstrate the effectiveness and robustness of the proposed method.",graph representation learning,
On the vulnerability of fingerprint verification systems to fake fingerprint attacks,"A new method to generate gummy fingers is presented. A medium-size fake

test with fake fingerprints, and enrollment with real fingerprints and test
with fake fingerprints. Results for an optical and a thermal sweeping sensors
are given. Both systems are shown to be vulnerable to direct attacks.",fake fingerprint attacks,
"Benchmarking zero-shot and few-shot approaches for tokenization, tagging, and dependency parsing of Tagalog text","The grammatical analysis of texts in any written language typically involves
a number of basic processing tasks, such as tokenization, morphological
tagging, and dependency parsing. State-of-the-art systems can achieve high
accuracy on these tasks for languages with large datasets, but yield poor
results for languages which have little to no annotated data. To address this
issue for the Tagalog language, we investigate the use of alternative language
resources for creating task-specific models in the absence of
dependency-annotated Tagalog data. We also explore the use of word embeddings
and data augmentation to improve performance when only a small amount of
annotated Tagalog data is available. We show that these zero-shot and few-shot
approaches yield substantial improvements on grammatical analysis of both
in-domain and out-of-domain Tagalog text compared to state-of-the-art
supervised baselines.",Tagalog text processing,
Fairness in generative modeling,"We design general-purpose algorithms for addressing fairness issues and mode
collapse in generative modeling. More precisely, to design fair algorithms for
as many sensitive variables as possible, including variables we might not be

use unsupervised fairness only, meaning no information related to the sensitive

A Variational Approach for Joint Image Recovery and Feature Extraction Based on Spatially-Varying Generalised Gaussian Models,"The joint problem of reconstruction / feature extraction is a challenging
task in image processing. It consists in performing, in a joint manner, the
restoration of an image and the extraction of its features. In this work, we
firstly propose a novel nonsmooth and non-convex variational formulation of the
problem. For this purpose, we introduce a versatile generalised Gaussian prior
whose parameters, including its exponent, are space-variant. Secondly, we
design an alternating proximal-based optimisation algorithm that efficiently
exploits the structure of the proposed non-convex objective function. We also
analyse the convergence of this algorithm. As shown in numerical experiments
conducted on joint deblurring/segmentation tasks, the proposed method provides
high-quality results.",image recovery,
Goal-directed Planning and Goal Understanding by Active Inference: Evaluation Through Simulated and Physical Robot Experiments,"We show that goal-directed action planning and generation in a teleological
framework can be formulated using the free energy principle. The proposed
model, which is built on a variational recurrent neural network model, is
characterized by three essential features. These are that (1) goals can be
specified for both static sensory states, e.g., for goal images to be reached
and dynamic processes, e.g., for moving around an object, (2) the model can not
only generate goal-directed action plans, but can also understand goals by
sensory observation, and (3) the model generates future action plans for given
goals based on the best estimate of the current state, inferred using past
sensory observations. The proposed model is evaluated by conducting experiments
on a simulated mobile agent as well as on a real humanoid robot performing

achieves the second best result in sense loss and sense gain detection

period, one can understand which senses were obtained or lost. This allows
providing more detailed information about semantic change to the user and makes
our method interpretable.",lexical semantic change detection,
Learning to Find Proofs and Theorems by Learning to Refine Search Strategies: The Case of Loop Invariant Synthesis,"We propose a new approach to automated theorem proving where an

self-training to generate tasks of suitable relevance and difficulty for the
learner. This allows leveraging minimal amounts of domain knowledge to tackle
problems for which training data is unavailable or hard to synthesize. As a
specific illustration, we consider loop invariant synthesis for imperative
programs and use neural networks to refine both the teacher and solver
strategies.",Automated Theorem Proving,
Post-Train Adaptive MobileNet for Fast Anti-Spoofing,"Many applications require high accuracy of neural networks as well as low
latency and user data privacy guaranty. Face anti-spoofing is one of such
tasks. However, a single model might not give the best results for different
device performance categories, while training multiple models is time
consuming. In this work we present Post-Train Adaptive (PTA) block. Such a
block is simple in structure and offers a drop-in replacement for the
MobileNetV2 Inverted Residual block. The PTA block has multiple branches with
different computation costs. The branch to execute can be selected on-demand
and at runtime; thus, offering different inference times and configuration
capability for multiple device tiers. Crucially, the model is trained once and
can be easily reconfigured after training, even directly on a mobile device. In
addition, the proposed approach shows substantially better overall performance
in comparison to the original MobileNetV2 as tested on CelebA-Spoof dataset.
Different PTA block configurations are sampled at training time, which also
decreases overall wall-clock time needed to train the model. While we present
computational results for the anti-spoofing problem, the MobileNetV2 with PTA
blocks is applicable to any problem solvable with convolutional neural
networks, which makes the results presented practically significant.",Face anti-spoofing,
Backtracking Counterfactuals,"Counterfactual reasoning -- envisioning hypothetical scenarios, or possible
worlds, where some circumstances are different from what (f)actually occurred
(counter-to-fact) -- is ubiquitous in human cognition. Conventionally,
counterfactually-altered circumstances have been treated as ""small miracles""
that locally violate the laws of nature while sharing the same initial
conditions. In Pearl's structural causal model (SCM) framework this is made
mathematically rigorous via interventions that modify the causal laws while the
values of exogenous variables are shared. In recent years, however, this purely
interventionist account of counterfactuals has increasingly come under scrutiny
from both philosophers and psychologists. Instead, they suggest a backtracking
account of counterfactuals, according to which the causal laws remain unchanged
in the counterfactual world; differences to the factual world are instead
""backtracked"" to altered initial conditions (exogenous variables). In the
present work, we explore and formalise this alternative mode of counterfactual
reasoning within the SCM framework. Despite ample evidence that humans
backtrack, the present work constitutes, to the best of our knowledge, the
first general account and algorithmisation of backtracking counterfactuals. We
discuss our backtracking semantics in the context of related literature and
draw connections to recent developments in explainable artificial intelligence
(XAI).",Counterfactual reasoning,
DocAsRef: An Empirical Study on Repurposing Reference-Based Summary Quality Metrics Reference-Freely,"Automated summary quality assessment falls into two categories:

paper, we hypothesize that the comparison methodologies used by some
reference-based metrics to evaluate a system summary against its corresponding
reference can be effectively adapted to assess it against its source document,
thereby transforming these metrics into reference-free ones. Experimental
results support this hypothesis. After being repurposed reference-freely, the
zero-shot BERTScore using the pretrained DeBERTa-large-MNLI model of <0.5B

various aspects on the SummEval and Newsroom datasets. It also excels in

NeROIC: Neural Rendering of Objects from Online Image Collections,"We present a novel method to acquire object representations from online image

estimated initial camera parameters, while leveraging coarse foreground object
masks to improve the training efficiency and geometry quality. We also
introduce a robust normal estimation technique which eliminates the effect of
geometric noise while retaining crucial details. Lastly, we extract surface
material properties and ambient illumination, represented in spherical
harmonics with extensions that handle transient elements, e.g. sharp shadows.
The union of these components results in a highly modular and efficient object

Intra and Cross-spectrum Iris Presentation Attack Detection in the NIR and Visible Domains,"Iris Presentation Attack Detection (PAD) is essential to secure iris
recognition systems. Recent iris PAD solutions achieved good performance by
leveraging deep learning techniques. However, most results were reported under
intra-database scenarios and it is unclear if such solutions can generalize
well across databases and capture spectra. These PAD methods run the risk of
overfitting because of the binary label supervision during the network
training, which serves global information learning but weakens the capture of
local discriminative features. This chapter presents a novel attention-based
deep pixel-wise binary supervision (A-PBS) method. A-PBS utilizes pixel-wise
supervision to capture the fine-grained pixel/patch-level cues and attention
mechanism to guide the network to automatically find regions where most
contribute to an accurate PAD decision. Extensive experiments are performed on
six NIR and one visible-light iris databases to show the effectiveness and
robustness of proposed A-PBS methods. We additionally conduct extensive
experiments under intra-/cross-database and intra-/cross-spectrum for detailed
analysis. The results of our experiments indicates the generalizability of the

Attention Mechanism Meets with Hybrid Dense Network for Hyperspectral Image Classification,"Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) are more suitable, indeed. However, fixed
kernel sizes make traditional CNN too specific, neither flexible nor conducive
to feature learning, thus impacting on the classification accuracy. The
convolution of different kernel size networks may overcome this problem by
capturing more discriminating and relevant information. In light of this, the
proposed solution aims at combining the core idea of 3D and 2D Inception net
with the Attention mechanism to boost the HSIC CNN performance in a hybrid
scenario. The resulting \textit{attention-fused hybrid network} (AfNet) is
based on three attention-fused parallel hybrid sub-nets with different kernels
in each block repeatedly using high-level features to enhance the final
ground-truth maps. In short, AfNet is able to selectively filter out the
discriminative features critical for classification. Several tests on HSI
datasets provided competitive results for AfNet compared to state-of-the-art

A Framework for CSI-Based Indoor Localization with 1D Convolutional Neural Networks,"Modern indoor localization techniques are essential to overcome the weak GPS

in Channel State Information (CSI) based indoor localization with signal

highly dynamic indoor spaces with complex interiors, thus a solution for
solving this issue is urgently needed to expand the applications of CSI to a
broader indoor space. In this paper, we propose an end-to-end solution
including data collection, pattern clustering, denoising, calibration and a
lightweight one-dimensional convolutional neural network (1D CNN) model with
CSI fingerprinting to tackle this problem. We have also created and plan to
open source a CSI dataset with a large amount of data collected across complex
indoor environments at Colorado State University. Experiments indicate that our
approach achieves up to 68.5% improved performance (mean distance error) with
minimal number of parameters, compared to the best-known deep machine learning

A Feasibility Study of Answer-Agnostic Question Generation for Education,"We conduct a feasibility study into the applicability of answer-agnostic
question generation models to textbook passages. We show that a significant

summarized input. We find that giving these models human-written summaries
instead of the original text results in a significant increase in acceptability
of generated questions (33% $\rightarrow$ 83%) as determined by expert
annotators. We also find that, in the absence of human-written summaries,
automatic summarization can serve as a good middle ground.",answer-agnostic question generation,

continuous data, but it loses the ability of using equivalence classes to
represent knowledge. To this end, this paper presents a granular-ball rough set
based on the granular-ball computing. The granular-ball rough set can
simultaneously represent Pawlak rough sets, and the neighborhood rough set, so
as to realize the unified representation of the two. This makes the
granular-ball rough set not only can deal with continuous data, but also can
use equivalence classes for knowledge representation. In addition, we propose
an implementation algorithms of granular-ball rough sets. The experimental
results on benchmark datasets demonstrate that, due to the combination of the
robustness and adaptability of the granular-ball computing, the learning
accuracy of the granular-ball rough set has been greatly improved compared with
the Pawlak rough set and the traditional neighborhood rough set. The
granular-ball rough set also outperforms nine popular or the state-of-the-art
feature selection methods.",granular-ball learning,
Image Reconstruction of Multi Branch Feature Multiplexing Fusion Network with Mixed Multi-layer Attention,"Image super-resolution reconstruction achieves better results than
traditional methods with the help of the powerful nonlinear representation
ability of convolution neural network. However, some existing algorithms also
have some problems, such as insufficient utilization of phased features,
ignoring the importance of early phased feature fusion to improve network
performance, and the inability of the network to pay more attention to
high-frequency information in the reconstruction process. To solve these
problems, we propose a multi-branch feature multiplexing fusion network with
mixed multi-layer attention (MBMFN), which realizes the multiple utilization of
features and the multistage fusion of different levels of features. To further
improve the networks performance, we propose a lightweight enhanced residual
channel attention (LERCA), which can not only effectively avoid the loss of
channel information but also make the network pay more attention to the key
channel information and benefit from it. Finally, the attention mechanism is
introduced into the reconstruction process to strengthen the restoration of
edge texture and other details. A large number of experiments on several
benchmark sets show that, compared with other advanced reconstruction
algorithms, our algorithm produces highly competitive objective indicators and
restores more image detail texture information.",image super-resolution reconstruction,
SPACE-3: Unified Dialog Model Pre-training for Task-Oriented Dialog Understanding and Generation,"Recently, pre-training methods have shown remarkable success in task-oriented
dialog (TOD) systems. However, most existing pre-trained models for TOD focus
on either dialog understanding or dialog generation, but not both. In this
paper, we propose SPACE-3, a novel unified semi-supervised pre-trained
conversation model learning from large-scale dialog corpora with limited
annotations, which can be effectively fine-tuned on a wide range of downstream
dialog tasks. Specifically, SPACE-3 consists of four successive components in a
single transformer to maintain a task-flow in TOD systems: (i) a dialog
encoding module to encode dialog history, (ii) a dialog understanding module to
extract semantic vectors from either user queries or system responses, (iii) a
dialog policy module to generate a policy vector that contains high-level
semantics of the response, and (iv) a dialog generation module to produce
appropriate responses. We design a dedicated pre-training objective for each
component. Concretely, we pre-train the dialog encoding module with span mask
language modeling to learn contextualized dialog information. To capture the
structured dialog semantics, we pre-train the dialog understanding module via a
novel tree-induced semi-supervised contrastive learning objective with the help
of extra dialog annotations. In addition, we pre-train the dialog policy module
by minimizing the L2 distance between its output policy vector and the semantic
vector of the response for policy optimization. Finally, the dialog generation
model is pre-trained by language modeling. Results show that SPACE-3 achieves
state-of-the-art performance on eight downstream dialog benchmarks, including
intent prediction, dialog state tracking, and end-to-end dialog modeling. We
also show that SPACE-3 has a stronger few-shot ability than existing models
under the low-resource setting.",task-oriented dialog,
The YiTrans End-to-End Speech Translation System for IWSLT 2022 Offline Shared Task,"This paper describes the submission of our end-to-end YiTrans speech
translation system for the IWSLT 2022 offline task, which translates from
English audio to German, Chinese, and Japanese. The YiTrans system is built on
large-scale pre-trained encoder-decoder models. More specifically, we first
design a multi-stage pre-training strategy to build a multi-modality model with
a large amount of labeled and unlabeled data. We then fine-tune the
corresponding components of the model for the downstream speech translation
tasks. Moreover, we make various efforts to improve performance, such as data
filtering, data augmentation, speech segmentation, model ensemble, and so on.
Experimental results show that our YiTrans system obtains a significant
improvement than the strong baseline on three translation directions, and it
achieves +5.2 BLEU improvements over last year's optimal end-to-end system on
tst2021 English-German. Our final submissions rank first on English-German and
English-Chinese end-to-end systems in terms of the automatic evaluation metric.
We make our code and models publicly available.",speech translation,
Wasserstein Graph Distance Based on $L_1$-Approximated Tree Edit Distance between Weisfeiler-Lehman Subtrees,"The Weisfeiler-Lehman (WL) test is a widely used algorithm in graph machine
learning, including graph kernels, graph metrics, and graph neural networks.
However, it focuses only on the consistency of the graph, which means that it
is unable to detect slight structural differences. Consequently, this limits
its ability to capture structural information, which also limits the
performance of existing models that rely on the WL test. This limitation is
particularly severe for traditional metrics defined by the WL test, which
cannot precisely capture slight structural differences. In this paper, we
propose a novel graph metric called the Wasserstein WL Subtree (WWLS) distance
to address this problem. Our approach leverages the WL subtree as structural
information for node neighborhoods and defines node metrics using the
$L_1$-approximated tree edit distance ($L_1$-TED) between WL subtrees of nodes.
Subsequently, we combine the Wasserstein distance and the $L_1$-TED to define
the WWLS distance, which can capture slight structural differences that may be
difficult to detect using conventional metrics. We demonstrate that the
proposed WWLS distance outperforms baselines in both metric validation and
graph classification experiments.",Graph Metric,
Automatic Rule Induction for Interpretable Semi-Supervised Learning,"Semi-supervised learning has shown promise in allowing NLP models to
generalize from small amounts of labeled data. Meanwhile, pretrained
transformer models act as black-box correlation engines that are difficult to
explain and sometimes behave unreliably. In this paper, we propose tackling
both of these challenges via Automatic Rule Induction (ARI), a simple and
general-purpose framework for the automatic discovery and integration of
symbolic rules into pretrained transformer models. First, we extract weak
symbolic rules from low-capacity machine learning models trained on small
amounts of labeled data. Next, we use an attention mechanism to integrate these
rules into high-capacity pretrained transformer models. Last, the
rule-augmented system becomes part of a self-training framework to boost
supervision signal on unlabeled data. These steps can be layered beneath a
variety of existing weak supervision and semi-supervised NLP algorithms in
order to improve performance and interpretability. Experiments across nine
sequence classification and relation extraction tasks suggest that ARI can
improve state-of-the-art methods with no manual effort and minimal
computational overhead.",Semi-supervised learning,
Measuring the Impact of Individual Domain Factors in Self-Supervised Pre-Training,"Human speech data comprises a rich set of domain factors such as accent,
syntactic and semantic variety, or acoustic environment. Previous work explores
the effect of domain mismatch in automatic speech recognition between
pre-training and fine-tuning as a whole but does not dissect the contribution
of individual factors. In this paper, we present a controlled study to better
understand the effect of such factors on the performance of pre-trained
representations on automatic speech recognition. To do so, we pre-train models
either on modified natural speech or synthesized audio, with a single domain
factor modified, and then measure performance after fine-tuning. Results show
that phonetic domain factors play an important role during pre-training while
grammatical and syntactic factors are far less important. To our knowledge,
this is the first study to better understand the domain characteristics of
pre-trained sets in self-supervised pre-training for speech.",self-supervised pre-training,
Label uncertainty-guided multi-stream model for disease screening,"The annotation of disease severity for medical image datasets often relies on
collaborative decisions from multiple human graders. The intra-observer
variability derived from individual differences always persists in this
process, yet the influence is often underestimated. In this paper, we cast the
intra-observer variability as an uncertainty problem and incorporate the label
uncertainty information as guidance into the disease screening model to improve
the final decision. The main idea is dividing the images into simple and hard
cases by uncertainty information, and then developing a multi-stream network to
deal with different cases separately. Particularly, for hard cases, we
strengthen the network's capacity in capturing the correct disease features and
resisting the interference of uncertainty. Experiments on a fundus image-based
glaucoma screening case study show that the proposed model outperforms several
baselines, especially in screening hard cases.",disease screening,
NPBG++: Accelerating Neural Point-Based Graphics,"We present a new system (NPBG++) for the novel view synthesis (NVS) task that
achieves high rendering realism with low scene fitting time. Our method
efficiently leverages the multiview observations and the point cloud of a
static scene to predict a neural descriptor for each point, improving upon the
pipeline of Neural Point-Based Graphics in several important ways. By
predicting the descriptors with a single pass through the source images, we
lift the requirement of per-scene optimization while also making the neural
descriptors view-dependent and more suitable for scenes with strong
non-Lambertian effects. In our comparisons, the proposed system outperforms
previous NVS approaches in terms of fitting and rendering runtimes while
producing images of similar quality.",novel view synthesis,
WikiLink: an encyclopedia-based semantic network for design innovation,"Data-driven design and innovation is a process to reuse and provide valuable
and useful information. However, existing semantic networks for design
innovation is built on data source restricted to technological and scientific
information. Besides, existing studies build the edges of a semantic network
only on either statistical or semantic relationships, which is less likely to
make full use of the benefits from both types of relationships and discover
implicit knowledge for design innovation. Therefore, we constructed WikiLink, a
semantic network based on Wikipedia. Combined weight which fuses both the
statistic and semantic weights between concepts is introduced in WikiLink, and
four algorithms are developed for inspiring new ideas. Evaluation experiments
are undertaken and results show that the network is characterised by high
coverage of terms, relationships and disciplines, which proves the network's
effectiveness and usefulness. Then a demonstration and case study results
indicate that WikiLink can serve as an idea generation tool for innovation in

provided open-source for more users to explore and build on.",design innovation,
Cross-Architecture Knowledge Distillation,"Transformer attracts much attention because of its ability to learn global
relations and superior performance. In order to achieve higher performance, it
is natural to distill complementary knowledge from Transformer to convolutional
neural network (CNN). However, most existing knowledge distillation methods
only consider homologous-architecture distillation, such as distilling
knowledge from CNN to CNN. They may not be suitable when applying to
cross-architecture scenarios, such as from Transformer to CNN. To deal with
this problem, a novel cross-architecture knowledge distillation method is
proposed. Specifically, instead of directly mimicking output/intermediate
features of the teacher, partially cross attention projector and group-wise
linear projector are introduced to align the student features with the
teacher's in two projected feature spaces. And a multi-view robust training
scheme is further presented to improve the robustness and stability of the
framework. Extensive experiments show that the proposed method outperforms 14
state-of-the-arts on both small-scale and large-scale datasets.",knowledge distillation,
WIDER & CLOSER: Mixture of Short-channel Distillers for Zero-shot Cross-lingual Named Entity Recognition,"Zero-shot cross-lingual named entity recognition (NER) aims at transferring
knowledge from annotated and rich-resource data in source languages to
unlabeled and lean-resource data in target languages. Existing mainstream
methods based on the teacher-student distillation framework ignore the rich and
complementary information lying in the intermediate layers of pre-trained
language models, and domain-invariant information is easily lost during
transfer. In this study, a mixture of short-channel distillers (MSD) method is
proposed to fully interact the rich hierarchical information in the teacher
model and to transfer knowledge to the student model sufficiently and
efficiently. Concretely, a multi-channel distillation framework is designed for
sufficient information transfer by aggregating multiple distillers as a
mixture. Besides, an unsupervised method adopting parallel domain adaptation is
proposed to shorten the channels between the teacher and student models to
preserve domain-invariant features. Experiments on four datasets across nine
languages demonstrate that the proposed method achieves new state-of-the-art
performance on zero-shot cross-lingual NER and shows great generalization and
compatibility across languages and fields.",cross-lingual named entity recognition,
Towards an efficient Iris Recognition System on Embedded Devices,"Iris Recognition (IR) is one of the market's most reliable and accurate
biometric systems. Today, it is challenging to build NIR-capturing devices
under the premise of hardware price reduction. Commercial NIR sensors are
protected from modification. The process of building a new device is not
trivial because it is required to start from scratch with the process of
capturing images with quality, calibrating operational distances, and building
lightweight software such as eyes/iris detectors and segmentation sub-systems.
In light of such challenges, this work aims to develop and implement iris
recognition software in an embedding system and calibrate NIR in a contactless
binocular setup. We evaluate and contrast speed versus performance obtained
with two embedded computers and infrared cameras. Further, a lightweight
segmenter sub-system called ""Unet_xxs"" is proposed, which can be used for iris
semantic segmentation under restricted memory resources.",iris recognition,
Temporal Link Prediction via Adjusted Sigmoid Function and 2-Simplex Sructure,"Temporal network link prediction is an important task in the field of network
science, and has a wide range of applications in practical scenarios. Revealing
the evolutionary mechanism of the network is essential for link prediction, and
how to effectively utilize the historical information for temporal links and
efficiently extract the high-order patterns of network structure remains a
vital challenge. To address these issues, in this paper, we propose a novel
temporal link prediction model with adjusted sigmoid function and 2-simplex
structure (TLPSS). The adjusted sigmoid decay mode takes the active, decay and
stable states of edges into account, which properly fits the life cycle of
information. Moreover, the latent matrix sequence is introduced, which is
composed of simplex high-order structure, to enhance the performance of link
prediction method since it is highly feasible in sparse network. Combining the
life cycle of information and simplex high-order structure, the overall
performance of TLPSS is achieved by satisfying the consistency of temporal and
structural information in dynamic networks. Experimental results on six
real-world datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of TLPSS, and our proposed
model improves the performance of link prediction by an average of 15% compared
to other baseline methods.",temporal link prediction,
An Overview & Analysis of Sequence-to-Sequence Emotional Voice Conversion,"Emotional voice conversion (EVC) focuses on converting a speech utterance
from a source to a target emotion; it can thus be a key enabling technology for
human-computer interaction applications and beyond. However, EVC remains an
unsolved research problem with several challenges. In particular, as speech
rate and rhythm are two key factors of emotional conversion, models have to
generate output sequences of differing length. Sequence-to-sequence modelling
is recently emerging as a competitive paradigm for models that can overcome
those challenges. In an attempt to stimulate further research in this promising
new direction, recent sequence-to-sequence EVC papers were systematically
investigated and reviewed from six perspectives: their motivation, training
strategies, model architectures, datasets, model inputs, and evaluation
methods. This information is organised to provide the research community with
an easily digestible overview of the current state-of-the-art. Finally, we
discuss existing challenges of sequence-to-sequence EVC.",Emotional voice conversion,
Testing the limits of natural language models for predicting human language judgments,"Neural network language models can serve as computational hypotheses about
how humans process language. We compared the model-human consistency of diverse
language models using a novel experimental approach: controversial sentence
pairs. For each controversial sentence pair, two language models disagree about
which sentence is more likely to occur in natural text. Considering nine
language models (including n-gram, recurrent neural networks, and transformer
models), we created hundreds of such controversial sentence pairs by either
selecting sentences from a corpus or synthetically optimizing sentence pairs to
be highly controversial. Human subjects then provided judgments indicating for
each pair which of the two sentences is more likely. Controversial sentence
pairs proved highly effective at revealing model failures and identifying
models that aligned most closely with human judgments. The most
human-consistent model tested was GPT-2, although experiments also revealed
significant shortcomings of its alignment with human perception.",predicting human judgments,
Consistency and Accuracy of CelebA Attribute Values,"We report the first systematic analysis of the experimental foundations of
facial attribute classification. Two annotators independently assigning
attribute values shows that only 12 of 40 common attributes are assigned values
with >= 95% consistency, and three (high cheekbones, pointed nose, oval face)
have essentially random consistency. Of 5,068 duplicate face appearances in
CelebA, attributes have contradicting values on from 10 to 860 of the 5,068
duplicates. Manual audit of a subset of CelebA estimates error rates as high as
40% for (no beard=false), even though the labeling consistency experiment
indicates that no beard could be assigned with >= 95% consistency. Selecting
the mouth slightly open (MSO) for deeper analysis, we estimate the error rate
for (MSO=true) at about 20% and (MSO=false) at about 2%. A corrected version of
the MSO attribute values enables learning a model that achieves higher accuracy
than previously reported for MSO. Corrected values for CelebA MSO are available
at https://github.com/HaiyuWu/CelebAMSO.",facial attribute classification,
Measurement-Consistent Networks via a Deep Implicit Layer for Solving Inverse Problems,"End-to-end deep neural networks (DNNs) have become the state-of-the-art
(SOTA) for solving inverse problems. Despite their outstanding performance,
during deployment, such networks are sensitive to minor variations in the
testing pipeline and often fail to reconstruct small but important details, a
feature critical in medical imaging, astronomy, or defence. Such instabilities
in DNNs can be explained by the fact that they ignore the forward measurement
model during deployment, and thus fail to enforce consistency between their
output and the input measurements. To overcome this, we propose a framework
that transforms any DNN for inverse problems into a measurement-consistent one.
This is done by appending to it an implicit layer (or deep equilibrium network)
designed to solve a model-based optimization problem. The implicit layer
consists of a shallow learnable network that can be integrated into the
end-to-end training while keeping the SOTA DNN fixed. Experiments on
single-image super-resolution show that the proposed framework leads to
significant improvements in reconstruction quality and robustness over the SOTA
DNNs.",Inverse Problems Solving,
Fingerprint Image-Quality Estimation and its Application to Multialgorithm Verification,"Signal-quality awareness has been found to increase recognition rates and to
support decisions in multisensor environments significantly. Nevertheless,
automatic quality assessment is still an open issue. Here, we study the
orientation tensor of fingerprint images to quantify signal impairments, such
as noise, lack of structure, blur, with the help of symmetry descriptors. A
strongly reduced reference is especially favorable in biometrics, but less
information is not sufficient for the approach. This is also supported by
numerous experiments involving a simpler quality estimator, a trained method
(NFIQ), as well as the human perception of fingerprint quality on several
public databases. Furthermore, quality measurements are extensively reused to
adapt fusion parameters in a monomodal multialgorithm fingerprint recognition
environment. In this study, several trained and nontrained score-level fusion
schemes are investigated. A Bayes-based strategy for incorporating experts past
performances and current quality conditions, a novel cascaded scheme for
computational efficiency, besides simple fusion rules, is presented. The
quantitative results favor quality awareness under all aspects, boosting
recognition rates and fusing differently skilled experts efficiently as well as
effectively (by training).",Signal Quality Assessment,
$\textit{latent}$-GLAT: Glancing at Latent Variables for Parallel Text Generation,"Recently, parallel text generation has received widespread attention due to
its success in generation efficiency. Although many advanced techniques are
proposed to improve its generation quality, they still need the help of an
autoregressive model for training to overcome the one-to-many multi-modal
phenomenon in the dataset, limiting their applications. In this paper, we
propose $\textit{latent}$-GLAT, which employs the discrete latent variables to
capture word categorical information and invoke an advanced curriculum learning
technique, alleviating the multi-modality problem. Experiment results show that
our method outperforms strong baselines without the help of an autoregressive

decoding paradigm.",parallel text generation,
Cooperative Artificial Intelligence,"In the future, artificial learning agents are likely to become increasingly
widespread in our society. They will interact with both other learning agents
and humans in a variety of complex settings including social dilemmas. We argue
that there is a need for research on the intersection between game theory and
artificial intelligence, with the goal of achieving cooperative artificial
intelligence that can navigate social dilemmas well. We consider the problem of
how an external agent can promote cooperation between artificial learners by
distributing additional rewards and punishments based on observing the actions
of the learners. We propose a rule for automatically learning how to create the
right incentives by considering the anticipated parameter updates of each
agent. Using this learning rule leads to cooperation with high social welfare
in matrix games in which the agents would otherwise learn to defect with high
probability. We show that the resulting cooperative outcome is stable in
certain games even if the planning agent is turned off after a given number of
episodes, while other games require ongoing intervention to maintain mutual
cooperation. Finally, we reflect on what the goals of multi-agent reinforcement
learning should be in the first place, and discuss the necessary building
blocks towards the goal of building cooperative AI.",Cooperative agents,
Reward Uncertainty for Exploration in Preference-based Reinforcement Learning,"Conveying complex objectives to reinforcement learning (RL) agents often
requires meticulous reward engineering. Preference-based RL methods are able to
learn a more flexible reward model based on human preferences by actively
incorporating human feedback, i.e. teacher's preferences between two clips of
behaviors. However, poor feedback-efficiency still remains a problem in current
preference-based RL algorithms, as tailored human feedback is very expensive.
To handle this issue, previous methods have mainly focused on improving query
selection and policy initialization. At the same time, recent exploration
methods have proven to be a recipe for improving sample-efficiency in RL. We
present an exploration method specifically for preference-based RL algorithms.
Our main idea is to design an intrinsic reward by measuring the novelty based
on learned reward. Specifically, we utilize disagreement across ensemble of
learned reward models. Our intuition is that disagreement in learned reward
model reflects uncertainty in tailored human feedback and could be useful for
exploration. Our experiments show that exploration bonus from uncertainty in
learned reward improves both feedback- and sample-efficiency of
preference-based RL algorithms on complex robot manipulation tasks from
MetaWorld benchmarks, compared with other existing exploration methods that
measure the novelty of state visitation.",preference-based reinforcement learning,
PRBoost: Prompt-Based Rule Discovery and Boosting for Interactive Weakly-Supervised Learning,"Weakly-supervised learning (WSL) has shown promising results in addressing
label scarcity on many NLP tasks, but manually designing a comprehensive,

discovering novel labeling rules from data to improve the WSL model. Our
proposed model, named PRBoost, achieves this goal via iterative prompt-based
rule discovery and model boosting. It uses boosting to identify large-error
instances and then discovers candidate rules from them by prompting pre-trained
LMs with rule templates. The candidate rules are judged by human experts, and
the accepted rules are used to generate complementary weak labels and
strengthen the current model. Experiments on four tasks show PRBoost
outperforms state-of-the-art WSL baselines up to 7.1% and bridges the gaps with

Real-Time Multi-Modal Semantic Fusion on Unmanned Aerial Vehicles with Label Propagation for Cross-Domain Adaptation,"Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) equipped with multiple complementary sensors

for real-time semantic inference and fusion of multiple sensor modalities.
Semantic segmentation of LiDAR scans and RGB images, as well as object
detection on RGB and thermal images, run online onboard the UAV computer using
lightweight CNN architectures and embedded inference accelerators. We follow a
late fusion approach where semantic information from multiple sensor modalities
augments 3D point clouds and image segmentation masks while also generating an
allocentric semantic map. Label propagation on the semantic map allows for
sensor-specific adaptation with cross-modality and cross-domain supervision.

accomplish faster responses. Each machine is one of dual-hemisphere models
which are made of left and right hemispheres. The left hemisphere is used to

Trust Your $\nabla$: Gradient-based Intervention Targeting for Causal Discovery,"Inferring causal structure from data is a challenging task of fundamental
importance in science. Observational data are often insufficient to identify a
system's causal structure uniquely. While conducting interventions (i.e.,
experiments) can improve the identifiability, such samples are usually
challenging and expensive to obtain. Hence, experimental design approaches for
causal discovery aim to minimize the number of interventions by estimating the
most informative intervention target. In this work, we propose a novel
Gradient-based Intervention Targeting method, abbreviated GIT, that 'trusts'
the gradient estimator of a gradient-based causal discovery framework to
provide signals for the intervention acquisition function. We provide extensive
experiments in simulated and real-world datasets and demonstrate that GIT
performs on par with competitive baselines, surpassing them in the low-data
regime.",Causal Discovery,
BlanketGen - A synthetic blanket occlusion augmentation pipeline for MoCap datasets,"Human motion analysis has seen drastic improvements recently, however, due to

Training Vision-Language Transformers from Captions,"Vision-Language Transformers can be learned without low-level human labels
(e.g. class labels, bounding boxes, etc). Existing work, whether explicitly
utilizing bounding boxes or patches, assumes that the visual backbone must
first be trained on ImageNet class prediction before being integrated into a

introduce a new model Vision-Language from Captions (VLC) built on top of
Masked Auto-Encoders that does not require this supervision. In fact, in a
head-to-head comparison between ViLT, the current state-of-the-art patch-based
vision-language transformer which is pretrained with supervised object

Predictive linguistic cues for fake news: a societal artificial intelligence problem,"Media news are making a large part of public opinion and, therefore, must not
be fake. News on web sites, blogs, and social media must be analyzed before
being published. In this paper, we present linguistic characteristics of media
news items to differentiate between fake news and real news using machine
learning algorithms. Neural fake news generation, headlines created by
machines, semantic incongruities in text and image captions generated by
machine are other types of fake news problems. These problems use neural
networks which mainly control distributional features rather than evidence. We
propose applying correlation between features set and class, and correlation
among the features to compute correlation attribute evaluation metric and
covariance metric to compute variance of attributes over the news items.

Differentiable Frequency-based Disentanglement for Aerial Video Action Recognition,"We present a learning algorithm for human activity recognition in videos. Our
approach is designed for UAV videos, which are mainly acquired from obliquely
placed dynamic cameras that contain a human actor along with background motion.
Typically, the human actors occupy less than one-tenth of the spatial
resolution. Our approach simultaneously harnesses the benefits of frequency
domain representations, a classical analysis tool in signal processing, and
data driven neural networks. We build a differentiable static-dynamic frequency
mask prior to model the salient static and dynamic pixels in the video, crucial
for the underlying task of action recognition. We use this differentiable mask
prior to enable the neural network to intrinsically learn disentangled feature
representations via an identity loss function. Our formulation empowers the
network to inherently compute disentangled salient features within its layers.
Further, we propose a cost-function encapsulating temporal relevance and
spatial content to sample the most important frame within uniformly spaced
video segments. We conduct extensive experiments on the UAV Human dataset and

Weakly Supervised Grounding for VQA in Vision-Language Transformers,"Transformers for visual-language representation learning have been getting a
lot of interest and shown tremendous performance on visual question answering
(VQA) and grounding. But most systems that show good performance of those tasks
still rely on pre-trained object detectors during training, which limits their
applicability to the object classes available for those detectors. To mitigate
this limitation, the following paper focuses on the problem of weakly
supervised grounding in context of visual question answering in transformers.
The approach leverages capsules by grouping each visual token in the visual
encoder and uses activations from language self-attention layers as a
text-guided selection module to mask those capsules before they are forwarded
to the next layer. We evaluate our approach on the challenging GQA as well as
VQA-HAT dataset for VQA grounding. Our experiments show that: while removing
the information of masked objects from standard transformer architectures leads
to a significant drop in performance, the integration of capsules significantly
improves the grounding ability of such systems and provides new
state-of-the-art results compared to other approaches in the field.",visual question answering,

semantics of both questions and relevant knowledge from the KB; ii) generating
executable logical forms with both semantic and syntactic correctness. In this
paper, we present a new KBQA model, TIARA, which addresses those issues by
applying multi-grained retrieval to help the PLM focus on the most relevant KB
contexts, viz., entities, exemplary logical forms, and schema items. Moreover,
constrained decoding is used to control the output space and reduce generation
errors. Experiments over important benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness of
our approach. TIARA outperforms previous SOTA, including those using PLMs or
oracle entity annotations, by at least 4.1 and 1.1 F1 points on GrailQA and

A Framework to Generate High-Quality Datapoints for Multiple Novel Intent Detection,"Systems like Voice-command based conversational agents are characterized by a
pre-defined set of skills or intents to perform user specified tasks. In the
course of time, newer intents may emerge requiring retraining. However, the
newer intents may not be explicitly announced and need to be inferred
dynamically. Thus, there are two important tasks at hand (a). identifying
emerging new intents, (b). annotating data of the new intents so that the
underlying classifier can be retrained efficiently. The tasks become specially
challenging when a large number of new intents emerge simultaneously and there
is a limited budget of manual annotation. In this paper, we propose MNID
(Multiple Novel Intent Detection) which is a cluster based framework to detect
multiple novel intents with budgeted human annotation cost. Empirical results
on various benchmark datasets (of different sizes) demonstrate that MNID, by
intelligently using the budget for annotation, outperforms the baseline methods
in terms of accuracy and F1-score.",intent detection,
"Strong Admissibility, a Tractable Algorithmic Approach (proofs)","Much like admissibility is the key concept underlying preferred semantics,
strong admissibility is the key concept underlying grounded semantics, as
membership of a strongly admissible set is sufficient to show membership of the
grounded extension. As such, strongly admissible sets and labellings can be
used as an explanation of membership of the grounded extension, as is for
instance done in some of the proof procedures for grounded semantics. In the
current paper, we present two polynomial algorithms for constructing relatively
small strongly admissible labellings, with associated min-max numberings, for a
particular argument. These labellings can be used as relatively small
explanations for the argument's membership of the grounded extension. Although
our algorithms are not guaranteed to yield an absolute minimal strongly
admissible labelling for the argument (as doing do would have implied an
exponential complexity), our best performing algorithm yields results that are
only marginally bigger. Moreover, the runtime of this algorithm is an order of
magnitude smaller than that of the existing approach for computing an absolute
minimal strongly admissible labelling for a particular argument. As such, we
believe that our algorithms can be of practical value in situations where the
aim is to construct a minimal or near-minimal strongly admissible labelling in
a time-efficient way.",strong admissibility algorithms,
Learning Modular Structures That Generalize Out-of-Distribution,"Out-of-distribution (O.O.D.) generalization remains to be a key challenge for
real-world machine learning systems. We describe a method for O.O.D.
generalization that, through training, encourages models to only preserve
features in the network that are well reused across multiple training domains.
Our method combines two complementary neuron-level regularizers with a
probabilistic differentiable binary mask over the network, to extract a modular
sub-network that achieves better O.O.D. performance than the original network.
Preliminary evaluation on two benchmark datasets corroborates the promise of
our method.",out-of-distribution generalization,
"Deep Reinforcement Learning, a textbook","Deep reinforcement learning has gathered much attention recently. Impressive
results were achieved in activities as diverse as autonomous driving, game
playing, molecular recombination, and robotics. In all these fields, computer
programs have taught themselves to solve difficult problems. They have learned
to fly model helicopters and perform aerobatic manoeuvers such as loops and
rolls. In some applications they have even become better than the best humans,
such as in Atari, Go, poker and StarCraft. The way in which deep reinforcement
learning explores complex environments reminds us of how children learn, by
playfully trying out things, getting feedback, and trying again. The computer
seems to truly possess aspects of human learning; this goes to the heart of the
dream of artificial intelligence. The successes in research have not gone
unnoticed by educators, and universities have started to offer courses on the
subject. The aim of this book is to provide a comprehensive overview of the
field of deep reinforcement learning. The book is written for graduate students
of artificial intelligence, and for researchers and practitioners who wish to
better understand deep reinforcement learning methods and their challenges. We
assume an undergraduate-level of understanding of computer science and
artificial intelligence; the programming language of this book is Python. We
describe the foundations, the algorithms and the applications of deep
reinforcement learning. We cover the established model-free and model-based
methods that form the basis of the field. Developments go quickly, and we also
cover advanced topics: deep multi-agent reinforcement learning, deep
hierarchical reinforcement learning, and deep meta learning.",deep reinforcement learning,
Language Tokens: A Frustratingly Simple Approach Improves Zero-Shot Performance of Multilingual Translation,"This paper proposes a simple yet effective method to improve direct (X-to-Y)
translation for both cases: zero-shot and when direct data is available. We
modify the input tokens at both the encoder and decoder to include signals for
the source and target languages. We show a performance gain when training from
scratch, or finetuning a pretrained model with the proposed setup. In the
experiments, our method shows nearly 10.0 BLEU points gain on in-house datasets
depending on the checkpoint selection criteria. In a WMT evaluation campaign,
From-English performance improves by 4.17 and 2.87 BLEU points, in the
zero-shot setting, and when direct data is available for training,
respectively. While X-to-Y improves by 1.29 BLEU over the zero-shot baseline,
and 0.44 over the many-to-many baseline. In the low-resource setting, we see a
1.5~1.7 point improvement when finetuning on X-to-Y domain data.",multilingual translation,

annotated news articles for training and 400 news articles for testing. The
dataset contains news in five domains: (i) Health, (ii) Sports, (iii) Showbiz,
(iv) Technology, and (v) Business. 42 teams from 6 different countries (India,
China, Egypt, Germany, Pakistan, and the UK) registered for the task. 9 teams
submitted their experimental results. The participants used various machine
learning methods ranging from feature-based traditional machine learning to
neural network techniques. The best performing system achieved an F-score value
of 0.90, showing that the BERT-based approach outperforms other machine
learning classifiers.",fake news detection,
Dynamic Batch Adaptation,"Current deep learning adaptive optimizer methods adjust the step magnitude of
parameter updates by altering the effective learning rate used by each
parameter. Motivated by the known inverse relation between batch size and
learning rate on update step magnitudes, we introduce a novel training
procedure that dynamically decides the dimension and the composition of the
current update step. Our procedure, Dynamic Batch Adaptation (DBA) analyzes the
gradients of every sample and selects the subset that best improves certain
metrics such as gradient variance for each layer of the network. We present
results showing DBA significantly improves the speed of model convergence.
Additionally, we find that DBA produces an increased improvement over standard
optimizers when used in data scarce conditions where, in addition to
convergence speed, it also significantly improves model generalization,
managing to train a network with a single fully connected hidden layer using
only 1% of the MNIST dataset to reach 97.79% test accuracy. In an even more
extreme scenario, it manages to reach 97.44% test accuracy using only 10
samples per class. These results represent a relative error rate reduction of
81.78% and 88.07% respectively, compared to the standard optimizers, Stochastic
Gradient Descent (SGD) and Adam.",deep learning optimizers,
Scheduling with Predictions,"There is significant interest in deploying machine learning algorithms for
diagnostic radiology, as modern learning techniques have made it possible to
detect abnormalities in medical images within minutes. While machine-assisted
diagnoses cannot yet reliably replace human reviews of images by a radiologist,
they could inform prioritization rules for determining the order by which to
review patient cases so that patients with time-sensitive conditions could
benefit from early intervention.
  We study this scenario by formulating it as a learning-augmented online
scheduling problem. We are given information about each arriving patient's
urgency level in advance, but these predictions are inevitably error-prone. In
this formulation, we face the challenges of decision making under imperfect
information, and of responding dynamically to prediction error as we observe
better data in real-time. We propose a simple online policy and show that this
policy is in fact the best possible in certain stylized settings. We also
demonstrate that our policy achieves the two desiderata of online algorithms
with predictions: consistency (performance improvement with prediction
accuracy) and robustness (protection against the worst case). We complement our
theoretical findings with empirical evaluations of the policy under settings
that more accurately reflect clinical scenarios in the real world.",machine-assisted diagnostic radiology,
Language models show human-like content effects on reasoning tasks,"Abstract reasoning is a key ability for an intelligent system. Large language
models (LMs) achieve above-chance performance on abstract reasoning tasks, but
exhibit many imperfections. However, human abstract reasoning is also
imperfect. For example, human reasoning is affected by our real-world knowledge
and beliefs, and shows notable ""content effects""; humans reason more reliably
when the semantic content of a problem supports the correct logical inferences.
These content-entangled reasoning patterns play a central role in debates about
the fundamental nature of human intelligence. Here, we investigate whether
language models $\unicode{x2014}$ whose prior expectations capture some aspects
of human knowledge $\unicode{x2014}$ similarly mix content into their answers
to logical problems. We explored this question across three logical reasoning
tasks: natural language inference, judging the logical validity of syllogisms,
and the Wason selection task. We evaluate state of the art large language
models, as well as humans, and find that the language models reflect many of
the same patterns observed in humans across these tasks $\unicode{x2014}$ like
humans, models answer more accurately when the semantic content of a task
supports the logical inferences. These parallels are reflected both in answer
patterns, and in lower-level features like the relationship between model
answer distributions and human response times. Our findings have implications
for understanding both these cognitive effects in humans, and the factors that
contribute to language model performance.",LLM reasoning,
ECOLA: Enhanced Temporal Knowledge Embeddings with Contextualized Language Representations,"Since conventional knowledge embedding models cannot take full advantage of
the abundant textual information, there have been extensive research efforts in
enhancing knowledge embedding using texts. However, existing enhancement
approaches cannot apply to temporal knowledge graphs (tKGs), which contain
time-dependent event knowledge with complex temporal dynamics. Specifically,
existing enhancement approaches often assume knowledge embedding is
time-independent. In contrast, the entity embedding in tKG models usually
evolves, which poses the challenge of aligning temporally relevant texts with
entities. To this end, we propose to study enhancing temporal knowledge
embedding with textual data in this paper. As an approach to this task, we
propose Enhanced Temporal Knowledge Embeddings with Contextualized Language
Representations (ECOLA), which takes the temporal aspect into account and
injects textual information into temporal knowledge embedding. To evaluate
ECOLA, we introduce three new datasets for training and evaluating ECOLA.
Extensive experiments show that ECOLA significantly enhances temporal KG
embedding models with up to 287% relative improvements regarding Hits@1 on the
link prediction task. The code and models are publicly available on

$ \text{T}^3 $OMVP: A Transformer-based Time and Team Reinforcement Learning Scheme for Observation-constrained Multi-Vehicle Pursuit in Urban Area,"Smart Internet of Vehicles (IoVs) combined with Artificial Intelligence (AI)
will contribute to vehicle decision-making in the Intelligent Transportation
System (ITS). Multi-Vehicle Pursuit games (MVP), a multi-vehicle cooperative
ability to capture mobile targets, is becoming a hot research topic gradually.
Although there are some achievements in the field of MVP in the open space
environment, the urban area brings complicated road structures and restricted
moving spaces as challenges to the resolution of MVP games. We define an
Observation-constrained MVP (OMVP) problem in this paper and propose a
Transformer-based Time and Team Reinforcement Learning scheme ($ \text{T}^3
$OMVP) to address the problem. First, a new multi-vehicle pursuit model is
constructed based on decentralized partially observed Markov decision processes
(Dec-POMDP) to instantiate this problem. Second, by introducing and modifying
the transformer-based observation sequence, QMIX is redefined to adapt to the
complicated road structure, restricted moving spaces and constrained
observations, so as to control vehicles to pursue the target combining the
vehicle's observations. Third, a multi-intersection urban environment is built
to verify the proposed scheme. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that
the proposed $ \text{T}^3 $OMVP scheme achieves significant improvements
relative to state-of-the-art QMIX approaches by 9.66%~106.25%. Code is

BInGo: Bayesian Intrinsic Groupwise Registration via Explicit Hierarchical Disentanglement,"Multimodal groupwise registration aligns internal structures in a group of
medical images. Current approaches to this problem involve developing
similarity measures over the joint intensity profile of all images, which may
be computationally prohibitive for large image groups and unstable under
various conditions. To tackle these issues, we propose BInGo, a general
unsupervised hierarchical Bayesian framework based on deep learning, to learn
intrinsic structural representations to measure the similarity of multimodal
images. Particularly, a variational auto-encoder with a novel posterior is
proposed, which facilitates the disentanglement learning of structural
representations and spatial transformations, and characterizes the imaging
process from the common structure with shape transition and appearance
variation. Notably, BInGo is scalable to learn from small groups, whereas being
tested for large-scale groupwise registration, thus significantly reducing
computational costs. We compared BInGo with five iterative or deep learning
methods on three public intrasubject and intersubject datasets, i.e. BraTS,
MS-CMR of the heart, and Learn2Reg abdomen MR-CT, and demonstrated its superior
accuracy and computational efficiency, even for very large group sizes (e.g.,
over 1300 2D images from MS-CMR in each group).",Multimodal groupwise registration ,
IDE-3D: Interactive Disentangled Editing for High-Resolution 3D-aware Portrait Synthesis,"Existing 3D-aware facial generation methods face a dilemma in quality versus
editability: they either generate editable results in low resolution or
high-quality ones with no editing flexibility. In this work, we propose a new
approach that brings the best of both worlds together. Our system consists of
three major components: (1) a 3D-semantics-aware generative model that produces
view-consistent, disentangled face images and semantic masks; (2) a hybrid GAN
inversion approach that initialize the latent codes from the semantic and
texture encoder, and further optimized them for faithful reconstruction; and
(3) a canonical editor that enables efficient manipulation of semantic masks in
canonical view and product high-quality editing results. Our approach is
competent for many applications, e.g. free-view face drawing, editing, and
style control. Both quantitative and qualitative results show that our method
reaches the state-of-the-art in terms of photorealism, faithfulness, and
efficiency.",3D-aware portrait synthesis,
MiniDisc: Minimal Distillation Schedule for Language Model Compression,"Recent studies have uncovered that language model distillation is less
effective when facing a large capacity gap between the teacher and the student,
and introduced teacher assistant-based distillation to bridge the gap. As a
connection, the scale and the performance of the teacher assistant is of vital
importance to bring the knowledge from the teacher to the student. However,
existing teacher assistant-based methods require maximally many trials before
scheduling an optimal teacher assistant. To this end, we propose a minimal
distillation schedule (MiniDisc) for scheduling the optimal teacher assistant
in minimally one trial. In particular, motivated by the finding that the
performance of the student is positively correlated to the scale-performance
tradeoff of the teacher assistant, MiniDisc is designed with a
$\lambda$-tradeoff to measure the optimality of the teacher assistant without
trial distillation to the student. MiniDisc then can schedule the optimal
teacher assistant with the best $\lambda$-tradeoff in a sandwich framework.
MiniDisc is evaluated with an extensive set of experiments on GLUE.
Experimental results demonstrate the improved efficiency our MiniDisc compared
to several state-of-the-art baselines. We further apply MiniDisc to a language
model with billions of parameters and show its scalability.",language model distillation,
Language and Culture Internalisation for Human-Like Autotelic AI,"Building autonomous agents able to grow open-ended repertoires of skills
across their lives is a fundamental goal of artificial intelligence (AI). A
promising developmental approach recommends the design of intrinsically
motivated agents that learn new skills by generating and pursuing their own
goals - autotelic agents. But despite recent progress, existing algorithms
still show serious limitations in terms of goal diversity, exploration,
generalisation or skill composition. This perspective calls for the immersion
of autotelic agents into rich socio-cultural worlds, an immensely important
attribute of our environment that shapes human cognition but is mostly omitted
in modern AI. Inspired by the seminal work of Vygotsky, we propose Vygotskian
autotelic agents - agents able to internalise their interactions with others
and turn them into cognitive tools. We focus on language and show how its
structure and informational content may support the development of new
cognitive functions in artificial agents as it does in humans. We justify the
approach by uncovering several examples of new artificial cognitive functions
emerging from interactions between language and embodiment in recent works at
the intersection of deep reinforcement learning and natural language
processing. Looking forward, we highlight future opportunities and challenges
for Vygotskian Autotelic AI research, including the use of language models as
cultural models supporting artificial cognitive development.",autonomous agents,
Learning with Signatures,"In this work we investigate the use of the Signature Transform in the context
of Learning. Under this assumption, we advance a supervised framework that
potentially provides state-of-the-art classification accuracy with the use of
few labels without the need of credit assignment and with minimal or no
overfitting. We leverage tools from harmonic analysis by the use of the
signature and log-signature, and use as a score function RMSE and MAE Signature
and log-signature. We develop a closed-form equation to compute probably good
optimal scale factors, as well as the formulation to obtain them by
optimization. Techniques of Signal Processing are addressed to further
characterize the problem. Classification is performed at the CPU level orders
of magnitude faster than other methods. We report results on AFHQ, MNIST and
CIFAR10, achieving 100% accuracy on all tasks assuming we can determine at test
time which probably good optimal scale factor to use for each category.",signature transform,
Where and What: Driver Attention-based Object Detection,"Human drivers use their attentional mechanisms to focus on critical objects
and make decisions while driving. As human attention can be revealed from gaze
data, capturing and analyzing gaze information has emerged in recent years to
benefit autonomous driving technology. Previous works in this context have
primarily aimed at predicting ""where"" human drivers look at and lack knowledge
of ""what"" objects drivers focus on. Our work bridges the gap between
pixel-level and object-level attention prediction. Specifically, we propose to
integrate an attention prediction module into a pretrained object detection
framework and predict the attention in a grid-based style. Furthermore,
critical objects are recognized based on predicted attended-to areas. We
evaluate our proposed method on two driver attention datasets, BDD-A and
DR(eye)VE. Our framework achieves competitive state-of-the-art performance in
the attention prediction on both pixel-level and object-level but is far more
efficient (75.3 GFLOPs less) in computation.",object detection,
Correcting diacritics and typos with a ByT5 transformer model,"Due to the fast pace of life and online communications and the prevalence of
English and the QWERTY keyboard, people tend to forgo using diacritics, make
typographical errors (typos) when typing in other languages. Restoring
diacritics and correcting spelling is important for proper language use and the
disambiguation of texts for both humans and downstream algorithms. However,
both of these problems are typically addressed separately: the state-of-the-art
diacritics restoration methods do not tolerate other typos, but classical
spellcheckers also cannot deal adequately with all the diacritics missing. In
this work, we tackle both problems at once by employing the newly-developed
universal ByT5 byte-level seq2seq transformer model that requires no
language-specific model structures. For a comparison, we perform diacritics
restoration on benchmark datasets of 12 languages, with the addition of
Lithuanian. The experimental investigation proves that our approach is able to
achieve results (> 98%) comparable to the previous state-of-the-art, despite
being trained less and on fewer data. Our approach is also able to restore
diacritics in words not seen during training with > 76% accuracy. Our
simultaneous diacritics restoration and typos correction approach reaches > 94%
alpha-word accuracy on the 13 languages. It has no direct competitors and
strongly outperforms classical spell-checking or dictionary-based approaches.
We also demonstrate all the accuracies to further improve with more training.
Taken together, this shows the great real-world application potential of our
suggested methods to more data, languages, and error classes.",typos correction,
Egocentric Video Task Translation,"Different video understanding tasks are typically treated in isolation, and
even with distinct types of curated data (e.g., classifying sports in one
dataset, tracking animals in another). However, in wearable cameras, the
immersive egocentric perspective of a person engaging with the world around
them presents an interconnected web of video understanding tasks -- hand-object
manipulations, navigation in the space, or human-human interactions -- that
unfold continuously, driven by the person's goals. We argue that this calls for
a much more unified approach. We propose EgoTask Translation (EgoT2), which
takes a collection of models optimized on separate tasks and learns to
translate their outputs for improved performance on any or all of them at once.
Unlike traditional transfer or multi-task learning, EgoT2's flipped design
entails separate task-specific backbones and a task translator shared across
all tasks, which captures synergies between even heterogeneous tasks and
mitigates task competition. Demonstrating our model on a wide array of video
tasks from Ego4D, we show its advantages over existing transfer paradigms and
achieve top-ranked results on four of the Ego4D 2022 benchmark challenges.",egocentric video understanding,
ROCK: Causal Inference Principles for Reasoning about Commonsense Causality,"Commonsense causality reasoning (CCR) aims at identifying plausible causes
and effects in natural language descriptions that are deemed reasonable by an
average person. Although being of great academic and practical interest, this
problem is still shadowed by the lack of a well-posed theoretical framework;
existing work usually relies on deep language models wholeheartedly, and is
potentially susceptible to confounding co-occurrences. Motivated by classical
causal principles, we articulate the central question of CCR and draw parallels
between human subjects in observational studies and natural languages to adopt
CCR to the potential-outcomes framework, which is the first such attempt for
commonsense tasks. We propose a novel framework, ROCK, to Reason O(A)bout
Commonsense K(C)ausality, which utilizes temporal signals as incidental
supervision, and balances confounding effects using temporal propensities that
are analogous to propensity scores. The ROCK implementation is modular and
zero-shot, and demonstrates good CCR capabilities.",commonsense causality reasoning,

End-to-End Multi-View Structure-from-Motion with Hypercorrelation Volumes,"Image-based 3D reconstruction is one of the most important tasks in Computer
Vision with many solutions proposed over the last few decades. The objective is
to extract metric information i.e. the geometry of scene objects directly from
images. These can then be used in a wide range of applications such as film,
games, virtual reality, etc. Recently, deep learning techniques have been
proposed to tackle this problem. They rely on training on vast amounts of data
to learn to associate features between images through deep convolutional neural
networks and have been shown to outperform traditional procedural techniques.
In this paper, we improve on the state-of-the-art two-view
structure-from-motion(SfM) approach of [11] by incorporating 4D correlation
volume for more accurate feature matching and reconstruction. Furthermore, we
extend it to the general multi-view case and evaluate it on the complex

Automated Imbalanced Learning,"Automated Machine Learning has grown very successful in automating the
time-consuming, iterative tasks of machine learning model development. However,
current methods struggle when the data is imbalanced. Since many real-world
datasets are naturally imbalanced, and improper handling of this issue can lead
to quite useless models, this issue should be handled carefully. This paper
first introduces a new benchmark to study how different AutoML methods are
affected by label imbalance. Second, we propose strategies to better deal with
imbalance and integrate them into an existing AutoML framework. Finally, we
present a systematic study which evaluates the impact of these strategies and
find that their inclusion in AutoML systems significantly increases their
robustness against label imbalance.",Imbalanced Data Machine Learning,
Making Large Language Models Better Reasoners with Step-Aware Verifier,"Few-shot learning is a challenging task that requires language models to
generalize from limited examples. Large language models like GPT-3 and PaLM
have made impressive progress in this area, but they still face difficulties in
reasoning tasks such as GSM8K, a benchmark for arithmetic problems. To improve
their reasoning skills, previous work has proposed to guide the language model
with prompts that elicit a series of reasoning steps before giving the final
answer, achieving a significant improvement on GSM8K from 17.9% to 58.1% in
problem-solving rate. In this paper, we present DIVERSE (Diverse Verifier on
Reasoning Step), a novel approach that further enhances the reasoning
capability of language models. DIVERSE has three main components: first, it
generates diverse prompts to explore different reasoning paths for the same
question; second, it uses a verifier to filter out incorrect answers based on a
weighted voting scheme; and third, it verifies each reasoning step individually
instead of the whole chain. We evaluate DIVERSE on the latest language model

building inspection toolkit -- bikit -- which acts as a simple to use data hub
containing relevant open-source datasets in the field of damage recognition.
The datasets are enriched with evaluation splits and predefined metrics,
suiting the specific task and their data distribution. For the sake of

ignore the local geometrical structures between points representation. In this

with depthwise separable atrous convolution, and removes redundant dense
connections, retaining only valid feature flows while performing Siamese
feature fusion, greatly compressing parameters and computation amount. Compared

Persuasion Strategies in Advertisements,"Modeling what makes an advertisement persuasive, i.e., eliciting the desired
response from consumer, is critical to the study of propaganda, social
psychology, and marketing. Despite its importance, computational modeling of
persuasion in computer vision is still in its infancy, primarily due to the
lack of benchmark datasets that can provide persuasion-strategy labels
associated with ads. Motivated by persuasion literature in social psychology
and marketing, we introduce an extensive vocabulary of persuasion strategies
and build the first ad image corpus annotated with persuasion strategies. We
then formulate the task of persuasion strategy prediction with multi-modal
learning, where we design a multi-task attention fusion model that can leverage
other ad-understanding tasks to predict persuasion strategies. Further, we
conduct a real-world case study on 1600 advertising campaigns of 30 Fortune-500
companies where we use our model's predictions to analyze which strategies work
with different demographics (age and gender). The dataset also provides image
segmentation masks, which labels persuasion strategies in the corresponding ad

Effective Shortcut Technique for GAN,"In recent years, generative adversarial network (GAN)-based image generation
techniques design their generators by stacking up multiple residual blocks. The
residual block generally contains a shortcut, \ie skip connection, which
effectively supports information propagation in the network. In this paper, we
propose a novel shortcut method, called the gated shortcut, which not only
embraces the strength point of the residual block but also further boosts the
GAN performance. More specifically, based on the gating mechanism, the proposed
method leads the residual block to keep (or remove) information that is
relevant (or irrelevant) to the image being generated. To demonstrate that the
proposed method brings significant improvements in the GAN performance, this
paper provides extensive experimental results on the various standard datasets
such as CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, LSUN, and tiny-ImageNet. Quantitative evaluations
show that the gated shortcut achieves the impressive GAN performance in terms
of Frechet inception distance (FID) and Inception score (IS). For instance, the
proposed method improves the FID and IS scores on the tiny-ImageNet dataset

$\mathcal{Y}$-Tuning: An Efficient Tuning Paradigm for Large-Scale Pre-Trained Models via Label Representation Learning,"With the success of large-scale pre-trained models (PTMs), how efficiently
adapting PTMs to downstream tasks has attracted tremendous attention,

yet effective paradigm to adapt frozen large-scale PTMs to specific downstream
tasks. $\mathcal{Y}$-tuning learns dense representations for labels

$\mathcal{Y}$-tuning is both parameter-efficient and training-efficient. For

Towards Effective Image Manipulation Detection with Proposal Contrastive Learning,"Deep models have been widely and successfully used in image manipulation
detection, which aims to classify tampered images and localize tampered
regions. Most existing methods mainly focus on extracting global features from
tampered images, while neglecting the relationships of local features between
tampered and authentic regions within a single tampered image. To exploit such
spatial relationships, we propose Proposal Contrastive Learning (PCL) for
effective image manipulation detection. Our PCL consists of a two-stream
architecture by extracting two types of global features from RGB and noise
views respectively. To further improve the discriminative power, we exploit the
relationships of local features through a proxy proposal contrastive learning
task by attracting/repelling proposal-based positive/negative sample pairs.
Moreover, we show that our PCL can be easily adapted to unlabeled data in
practice, which can reduce manual labeling costs and promote more generalizable
features. Extensive experiments among several standard datasets demonstrate
that our PCL can be a general module to obtain consistent improvement. The code
is available at https://github.com/Sandy-Zeng/PCL.",image manipulation detection,
ReAFFPN: Rotation-equivariant Attention Feature Fusion Pyramid Networks for Aerial Object Detection,"This paper proposes a Rotation-equivariant Attention Feature Fusion Pyramid
Networks for Aerial Object Detection named ReAFFPN. ReAFFPN aims at improving
the effect of rotation-equivariant features fusion between adjacent layers
which suffers from the semantic and scale discontinuity. Due to the
particularity of rotational equivariant convolution, general methods are unable
to achieve their original effect while ensuring rotation equivariance of the
network. To solve this problem, we design a new Rotation-equivariant Channel
Attention which has the ability to both generate channel attention and keep
rotation equivariance. Then we embed a new channel attention function into
Iterative Attentional Feature Fusion (iAFF) module to realize
Rotation-equivariant Attention Feature Fusion. Experimental results demonstrate
that ReAFFPN achieves a better rotation-equivariant feature fusion ability and
significantly improve the accuracy of the Rotation-equivariant Convolutional
Networks.",rotation-equivariant feature fusion,
Lexical Complexity Controlled Sentence Generation,"Text generation rarely considers the control of lexical complexity, which
limits its more comprehensive practical application. We introduce a novel task
of lexical complexity controlled sentence generation, which aims at keywords to
sentence generation with desired complexity levels. It has enormous potential
in domains such as grade reading, language teaching and acquisition. The
challenge of this task is to generate fluent sentences only using the words of
given complexity levels. We propose a simple but effective approach for this
task based on complexity embedding. Compared with potential solutions, our
approach fuses the representations of the word complexity levels into the model
to get better control of lexical complexity. And we demonstrate the feasibility
of the approach for both training models from scratch and fine-tuning the
pre-trained models. To facilitate the research, we develop two datasets in
English and Chinese respectively, on which extensive experiments are conducted.
Results show that our approach better controls lexical complexity and generates
higher quality sentences than baseline methods.",Text generation,
Defense against adversarial attacks on deep convolutional neural networks through nonlocal denoising,"Despite substantial advances in network architecture performance, the
susceptibility of adversarial attacks makes deep learning challenging to
implement in safety-critical applications. This paper proposes a data-centric
approach to addressing this problem. A nonlocal denoising method with different
luminance values has been used to generate adversarial examples from the
Modified National Institute of Standards and Technology database (MNIST) and
Canadian Institute for Advanced Research (CIFAR-10) data sets. Under
perturbation, the method provided absolute accuracy improvements of up to 9.3%
in the MNIST data set and 13% in the CIFAR-10 data set. Training using
transformed images with higher luminance values increases the robustness of the
classifier. We have shown that transfer learning is disadvantageous for
adversarial machine learning. The results indicate that simple adversarial
examples can improve resilience and make deep learning easier to apply in
various applications.",adversarial attacks Defense,

The Massively Multilingual Natural Language Understanding 2022 (MMNLU-22) Workshop and Competition,"Despite recent progress in Natural Language Understanding (NLU), the creation
of multilingual NLU systems remains a challenge. It is common to have NLU
systems limited to a subset of languages due to lack of available data. They
also often vary widely in performance. We launch a three-phase approach to
address the limitations in NLU and help propel NLU technology to new heights.
We release a 52 language dataset called the Multilingual Amazon SLU resource

provide a competitive environment and push the state-of-the art in the
transferability of models into other languages. Finally, we host the first
Massively Multilingual NLU workshop which brings these components together. The

Cluster & Tune: Boost Cold Start Performance in Text Classification,"In real-world scenarios, a text classification task often begins with a cold
start, when labeled data is scarce. In such cases, the common practice of
fine-tuning pre-trained models, such as BERT, for a target classification task,
is prone to produce poor performance. We suggest a method to boost the
performance of such models by adding an intermediate unsupervised
classification task, between the pre-training and fine-tuning phases. As such
an intermediate task, we perform clustering and train the pre-trained model on
predicting the cluster labels. We test this hypothesis on various data sets,
and show that this additional classification phase can significantly improve
performance, mainly for topical classification tasks, when the number of
labeled instances available for fine-tuning is only a couple of dozen to a few
hundred.",text classification,
GPTs at Factify 2022: Prompt Aided Fact-Verification,"One of the most pressing societal issues is the fight against false news. The
false claims, as difficult as they are to expose, create a lot of damage. To
tackle the problem, fact verification becomes crucial and thus has been a topic
of interest among diverse research communities. Using only the textual form of
data we propose our solution to the problem and achieve competitive results
with other approaches. We present our solution based on two approaches - PLM
(pre-trained language model) based method and Prompt based method. The
PLM-based approach uses the traditional supervised learning, where the model is
trained to take 'x' as input and output prediction 'y' as P(y|x). Whereas,
Prompt-based learning reflects the idea to design input to fit the model such
that the original objective may be re-framed as a problem of (masked) language
modeling. We may further stimulate the rich knowledge provided by PLMs to
better serve downstream tasks by employing extra prompts to fine-tune PLMs. Our
experiments showed that the proposed method performs better than just
fine-tuning PLMs. We achieved an F1 score of 0.6946 on the FACTIFY dataset and
a 7th position on the competition leader-board.",fact verification,
PET: An Annotated Dataset for Process Extraction from Natural Language Text,"Process extraction from text is an important task of process discovery, for
which various approaches have been developed in recent years. However, in
contrast to other information extraction tasks, there is a lack of
gold-standard corpora of business process descriptions that are carefully
annotated with all the entities and relationships of interest. Due to this, it
is currently hard to compare the results obtained by extraction approaches in
an objective manner, whereas the lack of annotated texts also prevents the
application of data-driven information extraction methodologies, typical of the
natural language processing field. Therefore, to bridge this gap, we present
the PET dataset, a first corpus of business process descriptions annotated with
activities, gateways, actors, and flow information. We present our new
resource, including a variety of baselines to benchmark the difficulty and
challenges of business process extraction from text. PET can be accessed via

of videos recorded in outside settings. In addition to video question answering
(Video QA), we also introduce the new task of identifying visual support for a

CodeRetriever: Unimodal and Bimodal Contrastive Learning for Code Search,"In this paper, we propose the CodeRetriever model, which learns the
function-level code semantic representations through large-scale code-text
contrastive pre-training. We adopt two contrastive learning schemes in
CodeRetriever: unimodal contrastive learning and bimodal contrastive learning.
For unimodal contrastive learning, we design an unsupervised learning approach
to build semantic-related code pairs based on the documentation and function
name. For bimodal contrastive learning, we leverage the documentation and
in-line comments of code to build code-text pairs. Both contrastive objectives
can fully leverage large-scale code corpus for pre-training. Extensive
experimental results show that CodeRetriever achieves new state-of-the-art with
significant improvement over existing code pre-trained models, on eleven
domain/language-specific code search tasks with six programming languages in
different code granularity (function-level, snippet-level and statement-level).

The KITMUS Test: Evaluating Knowledge Integration from Multiple Sources in Natural Language Understanding Systems,"Many state-of-the-art natural language understanding (NLU) models are based
on pretrained neural language models. These models often make inferences using
information from multiple sources. An important class of such inferences are
those that require both background knowledge, presumably contained in a model's
pretrained parameters, and instance-specific information that is supplied at
inference time. However, the integration and reasoning abilities of NLU models
in the presence of multiple knowledge sources have been largely understudied.
In this work, we propose a test suite of coreference resolution subtasks that
require reasoning over multiple facts. These subtasks differ in terms of which
knowledge sources contain the relevant facts. We also introduce subtasks where
knowledge is present only at inference time using fictional knowledge. We
evaluate state-of-the-art coreference resolution models on our dataset. Our
results indicate that several models struggle to reason on-the-fly over
knowledge observed both at pretrain time and at inference time. However, with
task-specific training, a subset of models demonstrates the ability to
integrate certain knowledge types from multiple sources. Still, even the best
performing models seem to have difficulties with reliably integrating knowledge
presented only at inference time.",natural language understanding,
HINT: Hypernetwork Instruction Tuning for Efficient Zero- & Few-Shot Generalisation,"Recent NLP models have shown the remarkable ability to effectively generalise
`zero-shot' to new tasks using only natural language instructions as guidance.
However, many of these approaches suffer from high computational costs due to
their reliance on concatenating lengthy instructions with every input example,
resulting in costly reprocessing of the instruction. To avoid this, we
introduce Hypernetworks for INstruction Tuning (HINT), which convert task
instructions and examples into parameter-efficient modules inserted into an
underlying model using a pretrained text encoder, eliminating the need to
include instructions in the model input. The hypernetwork in HINT also produces
an encoded instruction, which we concatenate with encoded inputs during
decoding to further improve performance. HINT models outperform strong
state-of-the-art baselines by over 10% when controlling for compute (measured
in FLOPs). By converting instructions into modules, HINT models can effectively
disregard the length of instructions and few-shot example inputs in terms of
compute usage. As a result, HINT can enhance its performance by up to 25% by
incorporating additional few-shot data, while utilizing only up to 5% more
compute. This combines the strengths of parameter-efficient fine-tuning and
in-context learning.",Few-Shot Generalization,
Many Episode Learning in a Modular Embodied Agent via End-to-End Interaction,"In this work we give a case study of an embodied machine-learning (ML)
powered agent that improves itself via interactions with crowd-workers. The
agent consists of a set of modules, some of which are learned, and others
heuristic. While the agent is not ""end-to-end"" in the ML sense, end-to-end
interaction is a vital part of the agent's learning mechanism. We describe how
the design of the agent works together with the design of multiple annotation
interfaces to allow crowd-workers to assign credit to module errors from
end-to-end interactions, and to label data for individual modules. Over
multiple automated human-agent interaction, credit assignment, data annotation,
and model re-training and re-deployment, rounds we demonstrate agent
improvement.",embodied machine-learning,
MeSHup: A Corpus for Full Text Biomedical Document Indexing,"Medical Subject Heading (MeSH) indexing refers to the problem of assigning a
given biomedical document with the most relevant labels from an extremely large
set of MeSH terms. Currently, the vast number of biomedical articles in the
PubMed database are manually annotated by human curators, which is time
consuming and costly; therefore, a computational system that can assist the
indexing is highly valuable. When developing supervised MeSH indexing systems,
the availability of a large-scale annotated text corpus is desirable. A
publicly available, large corpus that permits robust evaluation and comparison
of various systems is important to the research community. We release a large
scale annotated MeSH indexing corpus, MeSHup, which contains 1,342,667 full
text articles in English, together with the associated MeSH labels and
metadata, authors, and publication venues that are collected from the MEDLINE

Numerical Optimizations for Weighted Low-rank Estimation on Language Model,"Singular value decomposition (SVD) is one of the most popular compression
methods that approximate a target matrix with smaller matrices. However,
standard SVD treats the parameters within the matrix with equal importance,
which is a simple but unrealistic assumption. The parameters of a trained
neural network model may affect task performance unevenly, which suggests
non-equal importance among the parameters. Compared to SVD, the decomposition
method aware of parameter importance is the more practical choice in real
cases. Unlike standard SVD, weighted value decomposition is a non-convex
optimization problem that lacks a closed-form solution. We systematically
investigated multiple optimization strategies to tackle the problem and
examined our method by compressing Transformer-based language models. Further,
we designed a metric to predict when the SVD may introduce a significant
performance drop, for which our method can be a rescue strategy. The extensive
evaluations demonstrate that our method can perform better than current SOTA
methods in compressing Transformer-based language models.",Singular value decomposition,
Labeling instructions matter in biomedical image analysis,"Biomedical image analysis algorithm validation depends on high-quality
annotation of reference datasets, for which labeling instructions are key.
Despite their importance, their optimization remains largely unexplored. Here,
we present the first systematic study of labeling instructions and their impact
on annotation quality in the field. Through comprehensive examination of
professional practice and international competitions registered at the MICCAI
Society, we uncovered a discrepancy between annotators' needs for labeling
instructions and their current quality and availability. Based on an analysis
of 14,040 images annotated by 156 annotators from four professional companies
and 708 Amazon Mechanical Turk (MTurk) crowdworkers using instructions with
different information density levels, we further found that including exemplary
images significantly boosts annotation performance compared to text-only
descriptions, while solely extending text descriptions does not. Finally,
professional annotators constantly outperform MTurk crowdworkers. Our study
raises awareness for the need of quality standards in biomedical image analysis

Neural Graphical Models,"Probabilistic Graphical Models are often used to understand dynamics of a
system. They can model relationships between features (nodes) and the
underlying distribution. Theoretically these models can represent very complex
dependency functions, but in practice often simplifying assumptions are made
due to computational limitations associated with graph operations. In this work
we introduce Neural Graphical Models (NGMs) which attempt to represent complex
feature dependencies with reasonable computational costs. Given a graph of
feature relationships and corresponding samples, we capture the dependency
structure between the features along with their complex function
representations by using a neural network as a multi-task learning framework.
We provide efficient learning, inference and sampling algorithms. NGMs can fit
generic graph structures including directed, undirected and mixed-edge graphs
as well as support mixed input data types. We present empirical studies that
show NGMs' capability to represent Gaussian graphical models, perform inference

mortality data provided by Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.",Probabilistic Graphical Models,
Self-Supervised Deep Learning to Enhance Breast Cancer Detection on Screening Mammography,"A major limitation in applying deep learning to artificial intelligence (AI)
systems is the scarcity of high-quality curated datasets. We investigate strong
augmentation based self-supervised learning (SSL) techniques to address this
problem. Using breast cancer detection as an example, we first identify a
mammogram-specific transformation paradigm and then systematically compare four
recent SSL methods representing a diversity of approaches. We develop a method
to convert a pretrained model from making predictions on uniformly tiled
patches to whole images, and an attention-based pooling method that improves
the classification performance. We found that the best SSL model substantially
outperformed the baseline supervised model. The best SSL model also improved
the data efficiency of sample labeling by nearly 4-fold and was highly
transferrable from one dataset to another. SSL represents a major breakthrough
in computer vision and may help the AI for medical imaging field to shift away
from supervised learning and dependency on scarce labels.",Breast Cancer Detection,
HOP: History-and-Order Aware Pre-training for Vision-and-Language Navigation,"Pre-training has been adopted in a few of recent works for
Vision-and-Language Navigation (VLN). However, previous pre-training methods
for VLN either lack the ability to predict future actions or ignore the
trajectory contexts, which are essential for a greedy navigation process. In
this work, to promote the learning of spatio-temporal visual-textual
correspondence as well as the agent's capability of decision making, we propose
a novel history-and-order aware pre-training paradigm (HOP) with VLN-specific
objectives that exploit the past observations and support future action
prediction. Specifically, in addition to the commonly used Masked Language
Modeling (MLM) and Trajectory-Instruction Matching (TIM), we design two proxy
tasks to model temporal order information: Trajectory Order Modeling (TOM) and
Group Order Modeling (GOM). Moreover, our navigation action prediction is also
enhanced by introducing the task of Action Prediction with History (APH), which
takes into account the history visual perceptions. Extensive experimental
results on four downstream VLN tasks (R2R, REVERIE, NDH, RxR) demonstrate the
effectiveness of our proposed method compared against several state-of-the-art

Adaptive Graph Spatial-Temporal Transformer Network for Traffic Flow Forecasting,"Traffic flow forecasting on graphs has real-world applications in many
fields, such as transportation system and computer networks. Traffic
forecasting can be highly challenging due to complex spatial-temporal
correlations and non-linear traffic patterns. Existing works mostly model such
spatial-temporal dependencies by considering spatial correlations and temporal
correlations separately and fail to model the direct spatial-temporal
correlations. Inspired by the recent success of transformers in the graph
domain, in this paper, we propose to directly model the cross-spatial-temporal
correlations on the spatial-temporal graph using local multi-head
self-attentions. To reduce the time complexity, we set the attention receptive
field to the spatially neighboring nodes, and we also introduce an adaptive
graph to capture the hidden spatial-temporal dependencies. Based on these
attention mechanisms, we propose a novel Adaptive Graph Spatial-Temporal
Transformer Network (ASTTN), which stacks multiple spatial-temporal attention
layers to apply self-attention on the input graph, followed by linear layers
for predictions. Experimental results on public traffic network datasets,
METR-LA PEMS-BAY, PeMSD4, and PeMSD7, demonstrate the superior performance of
our model.",traffic flow forecasting,
Relphormer: Relational Graph Transformer for Knowledge Graph Representations,"Transformers have achieved remarkable performance in widespread fields,
including natural language processing, computer vision and graph mining.
However, vanilla Transformer architectures have not yielded promising
improvements in the Knowledge Graph (KG) representations, where the
translational distance paradigm dominates this area. Note that vanilla
Transformer architectures struggle to capture the intrinsically heterogeneous
structural and semantic information of knowledge graphs. To this end, we
propose a new variant of Transformer for knowledge graph representations dubbed
Relphormer. Specifically, we introduce Triple2Seq which can dynamically sample
contextualized sub-graph sequences as the input to alleviate the heterogeneity
issue. We propose a novel structure-enhanced self-attention mechanism to encode
the relational information and keep the semantic information within entities
and relations. Moreover, we utilize masked knowledge modeling for general
knowledge graph representation learning, which can be applied to various
KG-based tasks including knowledge graph completion, question answering, and
recommendation. Experimental results on six datasets show that Relphormer can

BootAug: Boosting Text Augmentation via Hybrid Instance Filtering Framework,"Text augmentation is an effective technique for addressing the problem of
insufficient data in natural language processing. However, existing text
augmentation methods tend to focus on few-shot scenarios and usually perform
poorly on large public datasets. Our research indicates that existing
augmentation methods often generate instances with shifted feature spaces,
which leads to a drop in performance on the augmented data (for example, EDA
generally loses $\approx 2\%$ in aspect-based sentiment classification). To
address this problem, we propose a hybrid instance-filtering framework
(BootAug) based on pre-trained language models that can maintain a similar
feature space with natural datasets. BootAug is transferable to existing text
augmentation methods (such as synonym substitution and back translation) and
significantly improves the augmentation performance by $\approx 2-3\%$ in
classification accuracy. Our experimental results on three classification tasks
and nine public datasets show that BootAug addresses the performance drop
problem and outperforms state-of-the-art text augmentation methods.
Additionally, we release the code to help improve existing augmentation methods
on large datasets.",text augmentation,
ESIE-BERT: Enriching Sub-words Information Explicitly with BERT for Joint Intent Classification and SlotFilling,"Natural language understanding (NLU) has two core tasks: intent
classification and slot filling. The success of pre-training language models
resulted in a significant breakthrough in the two tasks. One of the promising
solutions called BERT can jointly optimize the two tasks. We note that
BERT-based models convert each complex token into multiple sub-tokens by
wordpiece algorithm, which generates a mismatch between the lengths of the
tokens and the labels. This leads to BERT-based models do not do well in label
prediction which limits model performance improvement. Many existing models can
be compatible with this issue but some hidden semantic information is discarded
in the fine-tuning process. We address the problem by introducing a novel joint
method on top of BERT which explicitly models the multiple sub-tokens features
after wordpiece tokenization, thereby contributing to the two tasks. Our method
can well extract the contextual features from complex tokens by the proposed
sub-words attention adapter (SAA), which preserves overall utterance
information. Additionally, we propose an intent attention adapter (IAA) to
obtain the full sentence features to aid users to predict intent. Experimental
results confirm that our proposed model is significantly improved on two public
benchmark datasets. In particular, the slot filling F1 score is improved from
96.1 to 98.2 (2.1% absolute) on the Airline Travel Information Systems (ATIS)
dataset.",Natural language understanding,
Bridging the Domain Gap for Multi-Agent Perception,"Existing multi-agent perception algorithms usually select to share deep
neural features extracted from raw sensing data between agents, achieving a
trade-off between accuracy and communication bandwidth limit. However, these
methods assume all agents have identical neural networks, which might not be
practical in the real world. The transmitted features can have a large domain
gap when the models differ, leading to a dramatic performance drop in
multi-agent perception. In this paper, we propose the first lightweight
framework to bridge such domain gaps for multi-agent perception, which can be a
plug-in module for most existing systems while maintaining confidentiality. Our
framework consists of a learnable feature resizer to align features in multiple
dimensions and a sparse cross-domain transformer for domain adaption. Extensive
experiments on the public multi-agent perception dataset V2XSet have
demonstrated that our method can effectively bridge the gap for features from
different domains and outperform other baseline methods significantly by at
least 8% for point-cloud-based 3D object detection.",Multi-Agent Perception,
Towards Adversarially Robust Recommendation from Adaptive Fraudster Detection,"The robustness of recommender systems under node injection attacks has
garnered significant attention. Recently, GraphRfi, a GNN-based recommender
system, was proposed and shown to effectively mitigate the impact of injected

due to the supervised nature of its fraudster detection component, where
obtaining clean labels is challenging in practice. In particular, we propose a
powerful poisoning attack, MetaC, against both GNN-based and MF-based
recommender systems. Furthermore, we analyze why GraphRfi fails under such an
attack. Then, based on our insights obtained from vulnerability analysis, we
design an adaptive fraudster detection module that explicitly considers label
uncertainty. This module can serve as a plug-in for different recommender
systems, resulting in a robust framework named PDR. Comprehensive experiments
show that our defense approach outperforms other benchmark methods under
attacks. Overall, our research presents an effective framework for integrating

$¦Â$-DARTS: Beta-Decay Regularization for Differentiable Architecture Search,"Neural Architecture Search~(NAS) has attracted increasingly more attention in

gained popularity for the search efficiency. However, they suffer from two main
issues, the weak robustness to the performance collapse and the poor
generalization ability of the searched architectures. To solve these two
problems, a simple-but-efficient regularization method, termed as Beta-Decay,
is proposed to regularize the DARTS-based NAS searching process. Specifically,
Beta-Decay regularization can impose constraints to keep the value and variance
of activated architecture parameters from too large. Furthermore, we provide
in-depth theoretical analysis on how it works and why it works. Experimental
results on NAS-Bench-201 show that our proposed method can help to stabilize
the searching process and makes the searched network more transferable across

property of being less dependent on training time and data. Comprehensive

Plug & Play Attacks: Towards Robust and Flexible Model Inversion Attacks,"Model inversion attacks (MIAs) aim to create synthetic images that reflect
the class-wise characteristics from a target classifier's private training data
by exploiting the model's learned knowledge. Previous research has developed
generative MIAs that use generative adversarial networks (GANs) as image priors
tailored to a specific target model. This makes the attacks time- and
resource-consuming, inflexible, and susceptible to distributional shifts
between datasets. To overcome these drawbacks, we present Plug & Play Attacks,
which relax the dependency between the target model and image prior, and enable
the use of a single GAN to attack a wide range of targets, requiring only minor
adjustments to the attack. Moreover, we show that powerful MIAs are possible
even with publicly available pre-trained GANs and under strong distributional
shifts, for which previous approaches fail to produce meaningful results. Our
extensive evaluation confirms the improved robustness and flexibility of Plug &

prediction to address these challenges. Towards this end, we propose the
following algorithmic strategies: self-sufficient partitions, constraint-based
negative sampling, and edge mini-batch training. Both, partitioning strategy
and constraint-based negative sampling, avoid cross partition data transfer
during training. In our experimental evaluation, we show that our scaling
solution for GNN-based knowledge graph embedding models achieves a 16x speed up
on benchmark datasets while maintaining a comparable model performance as
non-distributed methods on standard metrics.",link prediction,
Chance-Constrained Optimization in Contact-Rich Systems for Robust Manipulation,"This paper presents a chance-constrained formulation for robust trajectory
optimization during manipulation. In particular, we present a
chance-constrained optimization for Stochastic Discrete-time Linear
Complementarity Systems (SDLCS). To solve the optimization problem, we
formulate Mixed-Integer Quadratic Programming with Chance Constraints (MIQPCC).
In our formulation, we explicitly consider joint chance constraints for
complementarity as well as states to capture the stochastic evolution of
dynamics. We evaluate robustness of our optimized trajectories in simulation on
several systems. The proposed approach outperforms some recent approaches for
robust trajectory optimization for SDLCS.",Trajectory Optimization,
Spherical Transformer,"Using convolutional neural networks for 360images can induce sub-optimal
performance due to distortions entailed by a planar projection. The distortion
gets deteriorated when a rotation is applied to the 360image. Thus, many
researches based on convolutions attempt to reduce the distortions to learn
accurate representation. In contrast, we leverage the transformer architecture
to solve image classification problems for 360images. Using the proposed
transformer for 360images has two advantages. First, our method does not
require the erroneous planar projection process by sampling pixels from the
sphere surface. Second, our sampling method based on regular polyhedrons makes
low rotation equivariance errors, because specific rotations can be reduced to
permutations of faces. In experiments, we validate our network on two aspects,
as follows. First, we show that using a transformer with highly uniform
sampling methods can help reduce the distortion. Second, we demonstrate that
the transformer architecture can achieve rotation equivariance on specific
rotations. We compare our method to other state-of-the-art algorithms using the
SPH-MNIST, SPH-CIFAR, and SUN360 datasets and show that our method is
competitive with other methods.",Spherical Image Classification,
Investigation of a Machine learning methodology for the SKA pulsar search pipeline,"The SKA pulsar search pipeline will be used for real time detection of
pulsars. Modern radio telescopes such as SKA will be generating petabytes of
data in their full scale of operation. Hence experience-based and data-driven
algorithms become indispensable for applications such as candidate detection.
Here we describe our findings from testing a state of the art object detection
algorithm called Mask R-CNN to detect candidate signatures in the SKA pulsar
search pipeline. We have trained the Mask R-CNN model to detect candidate
images. A custom annotation tool was developed to mark the regions of interest
in large datasets efficiently. We have successfully demonstrated this algorithm
by detecting candidate signatures on a simulation dataset. The paper presents
details of this work with a highlight on the future prospects.",pulsars detection,
Doubly Reparameterized Importance Weighted Structure Learning for Scene Graph Generation,"As a structured prediction task, scene graph generation, given an input
image, aims to explicitly model objects and their relationships by constructing
a visually-grounded scene graph. In the current literature, such task is
universally solved via a message passing neural network based mean field
variational Bayesian methodology. The classical loose evidence lower bound is
generally chosen as the variational inference objective, which could induce
oversimplified variational approximation and thus underestimate the underlying
complex posterior. In this paper, we propose a novel doubly reparameterized
importance weighted structure learning method, which employs a tighter
importance weighted lower bound as the variational inference objective. It is
computed from multiple samples drawn from a reparameterizable Gumbel-Softmax
sampler and the resulting constrained variational inference task is solved by a
generic entropic mirror descent algorithm. The resulting doubly reparameterized
gradient estimator reduces the variance of the corresponding derivatives with a
beneficial impact on learning. The proposed method achieves the
state-of-the-art performance on various popular scene graph generation
benchmarks.",scene graph generation,
2-d signature of images and texture classification,"We introduce a proper notion of 2-dimensional signature for images. This
object is inspired by the so-called rough paths theory, and it captures many
essential features of a 2-dimensional object such as an image. It thus serves
as a low-dimensional feature for pattern classification. Here we implement a
simple procedure for texture classification. In this context, we show that a
low dimensional set of features based on signatures produces an excellent
accuracy.",texture classification,
"Artificial Intelligence for Health Message Generation: Theory, Method, and an Empirical Study Using Prompt Engineering","This study introduces and examines the potential of an AI system to generate
health awareness messages. The topic of folic acid, a vitamin that is critical

messages that could be used to raise awareness and compared them to retweeted
human-generated messages via computational and human evaluation methods. The
system was easy to use and prolific, and computational analyses revealed that
the AI-generated messages were on par with human-generated ones in terms of
sentiment, reading ease, and semantic content. Also, the human evaluation study
showed that AI-generated messages ranked higher in message quality and clarity.
We discuss the theoretical, practical, and ethical implications of these

Face Presentation Attack Detection,"Face recognition technology has been widely used in daily interactive
applications such as checking-in and mobile payment due to its convenience and
high accuracy. However, its vulnerability to presentation attacks (PAs) limits
its reliable use in ultra-secure applicational scenarios. A presentation attack
is first defined in ISO standard as: a presentation to the biometric data
capture subsystem with the goal of interfering with the operation of the
biometric system. Specifically, PAs range from simple 2D print, replay and more
sophisticated 3D masks and partial masks. To defend the face recognition
systems against PAs, both academia and industry have paid extensive attention
to developing face presentation attack detection (PAD) technology (or namely
`face anti-spoofing (FAS)').",face presentation attack detection,
Template-based Recruitment Email Generation For Job Recommendation,"Text generation has long been a popular research topic in NLP. However, the
task of generating recruitment emails from recruiters to candidates in the job
recommendation scenario has received little attention by the research
community. This work aims at defining the topic of automatic email generation
for job recommendation, identifying the challenges, and providing a baseline
template-based solution for Danish jobs. Evaluation by human experts shows that
our method is effective. We wrap up by discussing the future research
directions for better solving this task.",Text generation,
Divide & Conquer Imitation Learning,"When cast into the Deep Reinforcement Learning framework, many robotics tasks
require solving a long horizon and sparse reward problem, where learning
algorithms struggle. In such context, Imitation Learning (IL) can be a powerful
approach to bootstrap the learning process. However, most IL methods require
several expert demonstrations which can be prohibitively difficult to acquire.
Only a handful of IL algorithms have shown efficiency in the context of an
extreme low expert data regime where a single expert demonstration is
available. In this paper, we present a novel algorithm designed to imitate
complex robotic tasks from the states of an expert trajectory. Based on a
sequential inductive bias, our method divides the complex task into smaller
skills. The skills are learned into a goal-conditioned policy that is able to
solve each skill individually and chain skills to solve the entire task. We
show that our method imitates a non-holonomic navigation task and scales to a
complex simulated robotic manipulation task with very high sample efficiency.",imitation learning,
GANimator: Neural Motion Synthesis from a Single Sequence,"We present GANimator, a generative model that learns to synthesize novel
motions from a single, short motion sequence. GANimator generates motions that
resemble the core elements of the original motion, while simultaneously
synthesizing novel and diverse movements. Existing data-driven techniques for
motion synthesis require a large motion dataset which contains the desired and
specific skeletal structure. By contrast, GANimator only requires training on a
single motion sequence, enabling novel motion synthesis for a variety of
skeletal structures e.g., bipeds, quadropeds, hexapeds, and more. Our framework
contains a series of generative and adversarial neural networks, each
responsible for generating motions in a specific frame rate. The framework
progressively learns to synthesize motion from random noise, enabling
hierarchical control over the generated motion content across varying levels of
detail. We show a number of applications, including crowd simulation, key-frame
editing, style transfer, and interactive control, which all learn from a single
input sequence. Code and data for this paper are at

Learning shape distributions from large databases of healthy organs: applications to zero-shot and few-shot abnormal pancreas detection,"We propose a scalable and data-driven approach to learn shape distributions
from large databases of healthy organs. To do so, volumetric segmentation masks
are embedded into a common probabilistic shape space that is learned with a
variational auto-encoding network. The resulting latent shape representations
are leveraged to derive zeroshot and few-shot methods for abnormal shape
detection. The proposed distribution learning approach is illustrated on a
large database of 1200 healthy pancreas shapes. Downstream qualitative and
quantitative experiments are conducted on a separate test set of 224 pancreas
from patients with mixed conditions. The abnormal pancreas detection AUC
reached up to 65.41% in the zero-shot configuration, and 78.97% in the few-shot
configuration with as few as 15 abnormal examples, outperforming a baseline
approach based on the sole volume.",abnormal pancreas detection,
Low-light Enhancement Method Based on Attention Map Net,"Low-light image enhancement is a crucial preprocessing task for some complex
vision tasks. Target detection, image segmentation, and image recognition
outcomes are all directly impacted by the impact of image enhancement. However,
the majority of the currently used image enhancement techniques do not produce
satisfactory outcomes, and these enhanced networks have relatively weak
robustness. We suggest an improved network called BrightenNet that uses U-Net
as its primary structure and incorporates a number of different attention
mechanisms as a solution to this issue. In a specific application, we employ
the network as the generator and LSGAN as the training framework to achieve
better enhancement results. We demonstrate the validity of the proposed network
BrightenNet in the experiments that follow in this paper. The results it
produced can both preserve image details and conform to human vision standards.",low-light image enhancement,
PERFECT: Prompt-free and Efficient Few-shot Learning with Language Models,"Current methods for few-shot fine-tuning of pretrained masked language models
(PLMs) require carefully engineered prompts and verbalizers for each new task
to convert examples into a cloze-format that the PLM can score. In this work,
we propose PERFECT, a simple and efficient method for few-shot fine-tuning of
PLMs without relying on any such handcrafting, which is highly effective given
as few as 32 data points. PERFECT makes two key design choices: First, we show
that manually engineered task prompts can be replaced with task-specific
adapters that enable sample-efficient fine-tuning and reduce memory and storage
costs by roughly factors of 5 and 100, respectively. Second, instead of using
handcrafted verbalizers, we learn new multi-token label embeddings during
fine-tuning, which are not tied to the model vocabulary and which allow us to
avoid complex auto-regressive decoding. These embeddings are not only learnable
from limited data but also enable nearly 100x faster training and inference.
Experiments on a wide range of few-shot NLP tasks demonstrate that PERFECT,
while being simple and efficient, also outperforms existing state-of-the-art
few-shot learning methods. Our code is publicly available at

LiSnowNet: Real-time Snow Removal for LiDAR Point Cloud,"LiDARs have been widely adopted to modern self-driving vehicles, providing 3D
information of the scene and surrounding objects. However, adverser weather
conditions still pose significant challenges to LiDARs since point clouds
captured during snowfall can easily be corrupted. The resulting noisy point
clouds degrade downstream tasks such as mapping. Existing works in de-noising
point clouds corrupted by snow are based on nearest-neighbor search, and thus
do not scale well with modern LiDARs which usually capture $100k$ or more
points at 10Hz. In this paper, we introduce an unsupervised de-noising
algorithm, LiSnowNet, running 52$\times$ faster than the state-of-the-art
methods while achieving superior performance in de-noising. Unlike previous
methods, the proposed algorithm is based on a deep convolutional neural network
and can be easily deployed to hardware accelerators such as GPUs. In addition,
we demonstrate how to use the proposed method for mapping even with corrupted
point clouds.", LiDAR Point Cloud,
Repairing $\mathcal{EL}$ Ontologies Using Weakening and Completing,"The quality of ontologies in terms of their correctness and completeness is
crucial for developing high-quality ontology-based applications. Traditional
debugging techniques repair ontologies by removing unwanted axioms, but may
thereby remove consequences that are correct in the domain of the ontology. In
this paper we propose an interactive approach to mitigate this for
$\mathcal{EL}$ ontologies by axiom weakening and completing. We present
algorithms for weakening and completing and present the first approach for
repairing that takes into account removing, weakening and completing. We show
different combination strategies, discuss the influence on the final ontologies
and show experimental results. We show that previous work has only considered
special cases and that there is a trade-off between the amount of validation
work for a domain expert and the quality of the ontology in terms of
correctness and completeness.",ontology repair,
Continual Learning For On-Device Environmental Sound Classification,"Continuously learning new classes without catastrophic forgetting is a
challenging problem for on-device environmental sound classification given the
restrictions on computation resources (e.g., model size, running memory). To
address this issue, we propose a simple and efficient continual learning
method. Our method selects the historical data for the training by measuring
the per-sample classification uncertainty. Specifically, we measure the
uncertainty by observing how the classification probability of data fluctuates
against the parallel perturbations added to the classifier embedding. In this
way, the computation cost can be significantly reduced compared with adding
perturbation to the raw data. Experimental results on the DCASE 2019 Task 1 and
ESC-50 dataset show that our proposed method outperforms baseline continual
learning methods on classification accuracy and computational efficiency,
indicating our method can efficiently and incrementally learn new classes
without the catastrophic forgetting problem for on-device environmental sound
classification.",environmental sound classification,
Differentiable SAR Renderer and SAR Target Reconstruction,"Forward modeling of wave scattering and radar imaging mechanisms is the key
to information extraction from synthetic aperture radar (SAR) images. Like
inverse graphics in optical domain, an inherently-integrated forward-inverse
approach would be promising for SAR advanced information retrieval and target
reconstruction. This paper presents such an attempt to the inverse graphics for
SAR imagery. A differentiable SAR renderer (DSR) is developed which
reformulates the mapping and projection algorithm of SAR imaging mechanism in
the differentiable form of probability maps. First-order gradients of the
proposed DSR are then analytically derived which can be back-propagated from
rendered image/silhouette to the target geometry and scattering attributes. A
3D inverse target reconstruction algorithm from SAR images is devised. Several
simulation and reconstruction experiments are conducted, including targets with
and without background, using both synthesized data or real measured inverse

proposed DSR and its inverse approach.",differentiable SAR renderer,
DuReader_retrieval: A Large-scale Chinese Benchmark for Passage Retrieval from Web Search Engine,"In this paper, we present DuReader_retrieval, a large-scale Chinese dataset
for passage retrieval. DuReader_retrieval contains more than 90K queries and
over 8M unique passages from a commercial search engine. To alleviate the
shortcomings of other datasets and ensure the quality of our benchmark, we (1)
reduce the false negatives in development and test sets by manually annotating
results pooled from multiple retrievers, and (2) remove the training queries
that are semantically similar to the development and testing queries.
Additionally, we provide two out-of-domain testing sets for cross-domain
evaluation, as well as a set of human translated queries for for cross-lingual
retrieval evaluation. The experiments demonstrate that DuReader_retrieval is
challenging and a number of problems remain unsolved, such as the salient
phrase mismatch and the syntactic mismatch between queries and paragraphs.
These experiments also show that dense retrievers do not generalize well across
domains, and cross-lingual retrieval is essentially challenging.

ALERT: Adapting Language Models to Reasoning Tasks,"Current large language models can perform reasonably well on complex tasks
that require step-by-step reasoning with few-shot learning. Are these models
applying reasoning skills they have learnt during pre-training and reason
outside of their training context, or are they simply memorizing their training
corpus at finer granularity and have learnt to better understand their context?
To tease apart these possibilities, we introduce ALERT, a benchmark and suite
of analyses for assessing language models' reasoning ability comparing
pre-trained and finetuned models on complex tasks that require reasoning skills
to solve. ALERT provides a test bed to asses any language model on fine-grained
reasoning skills, which spans over 20 datasets and covers 10 different
reasoning skills. We leverage ALERT to further investigate the role of
finetuning. With extensive empirical analysis we find that language models
learn more reasoning skills such as textual entailment, abductive reasoning,
and analogical reasoning during finetuning stage compared to pretraining state.
We also find that when language models are finetuned they tend to overfit to
the prompt template, which hurts the robustness of models causing
generalization problems.",language model reasoning,
Logic-Based Ethical Planning,"In this paper we propose a framework for ethical decision making in the

combination allows us to assess plans both with respect to an agent's values
and their desires, introducing the novel concept of the morality level of an
agent and moving towards multigoal, multivalue planning. We initiate the study
of computational complexity of planning tasks in our setting, and we discuss
potential applications to robotics.",ethical planning,
From Cloze to Comprehension: Retrofitting Pre-trained Masked Language Model to Pre-trained Machine Reader,"We present Pre-trained Machine Reader (PMR), a novel method for retrofitting
pre-trained masked language models (MLMs) to pre-trained machine reading
comprehension (MRC) models without acquiring labeled data. PMR can resolve the
discrepancy between model pre-training and downstream fine-tuning of existing
MLMs. To build the proposed PMR, we constructed a large volume of
general-purpose and high-quality MRC-style training data by using Wikipedia
hyperlinks and designed a Wiki Anchor Extraction task to guide the MRC-style
pre-training. Apart from its simplicity, PMR effectively solves extraction
tasks, such as Extractive Question Answering and Named Entity Recognition. PMR
shows tremendous improvements over existing approaches, especially in
low-resource scenarios. When applied to the sequence classification task in the
MRC formulation, PMR enables the extraction of high-quality rationales to
explain the classification process, thereby providing greater prediction
explainability. PMR also has the potential to serve as a unified model for
tackling various extraction and classification tasks in the MRC formulation.",machine reading comprehension,
A Benchmark of Long-tailed Instance Segmentation with Noisy Labels,"In this paper, we consider the instance segmentation task on a long-tailed
dataset, which contains label noise, i.e., some of the annotations are
incorrect. There are two main reasons making this case realistic. First,
datasets collected from real world usually obey a long-tailed distribution.
Second, for instance segmentation datasets, as there are many instances in one
image and some of them are tiny, it is easier to introduce noise into the
annotations. Specifically, we propose a new dataset, which is a large
vocabulary long-tailed dataset containing label noise for instance
segmentation. Furthermore, we evaluate previous proposed instance segmentation
algorithms on this dataset. The results indicate that the noise in the training
dataset will hamper the model in learning rare categories and decrease the
overall performance, and inspire us to explore more effective approaches to
address this practical challenge. The code and dataset are available in

Correlation between Alignment-Uniformity and Performance of Dense Contrastive Representations,"Recently, dense contrastive learning has shown superior performance on dense
prediction tasks compared to instance-level contrastive learning. Despite its
supremacy, the properties of dense contrastive representations have not yet
been carefully studied. Therefore, we analyze the theoretical ideas of dense
contrastive learning using a standard CNN and straightforward feature matching
scheme rather than propose a new complex method. Inspired by the analysis of
the properties of instance-level contrastive representations through the lens
of alignment and uniformity on the hypersphere, we employ and extend the same
lens for the dense contrastive representations to analyze their underexplored
properties. We discover the core principle in constructing a positive pair of
dense features and empirically proved its validity. Also, we introduces a new
scalar metric that summarizes the correlation between alignment-and-uniformity
and downstream performance. Using this metric, we study various facets of
densely learned contrastive representations such as how the correlation changes

KESA: A Knowledge Enhanced Approach For Sentiment Analysis,"Though some recent works focus on injecting sentiment knowledge into
pre-trained language models, they usually design mask and reconstruction tasks
in the post-training phase. In this paper, we aim to benefit from sentiment
knowledge in a lighter way. To achieve this goal, we study sentence-level
sentiment analysis and, correspondingly, propose two sentiment-aware auxiliary
tasks named sentiment word cloze and conditional sentiment prediction. The
first task learns to select the correct sentiment words within the input, given
the overall sentiment polarity as prior knowledge. On the contrary, the second
task predicts the overall sentiment polarity given the sentiment polarity of
the word as prior knowledge. In addition, two kinds of label combination
methods are investigated to unify multiple types of labels in each task. We
argue that more information can promote the models to learn more profound
semantic representation. We implement it in a straightforward way to verify
this hypothesis. The experimental results demonstrate that our approach
consistently outperforms pre-trained models and is additive to existing
knowledge-enhanced post-trained models. The code and data are released at

C2-CRS: Coarse-to-Fine Contrastive Learning for Conversational Recommender System,"Conversational recommender systems (CRS) aim to recommend suitable items to
users through natural language conversations. For developing effective CRSs, a
major technical issue is how to accurately infer user preference from very
limited conversation context. To address issue, a promising solution is to
incorporate external data for enriching the context information. However, prior
studies mainly focus on designing fusion models tailored for some specific type
of external data, which is not general to model and utilize multi-type external
data.
  To effectively leverage multi-type external data, we propose a novel
coarse-to-fine contrastive learning framework to improve data semantic fusion
for CRS. In our approach, we first extract and represent multi-grained semantic
units from different data signals, and then align the associated multi-type
semantic units in a coarse-to-fine way. To implement this framework, we design
both coarse-grained and fine-grained procedures for modeling user preference,
where the former focuses on more general, coarse-grained semantic fusion and
the latter focuses on more specific, fine-grained semantic fusion. Such an
approach can be extended to incorporate more kinds of external data. Extensive
experiments on two public CRS datasets have demonstrated the effectiveness of
our approach in both recommendation and conversation tasks.",Conversational Recommender Systems,
How Effective is Incongruity? Implications for Code-mix Sarcasm Detection,"The presence of sarcasm in conversational systems and social media like
chatbots, Facebook, Twitter, etc. poses several challenges for downstream NLP
tasks. This is attributed to the fact that the intended meaning of a sarcastic
text is contrary to what is expressed. Further, the use of code-mix language to
express sarcasm is increasing day by day. Current NLP techniques for code-mix
data have limited success due to the use of different lexicon, syntax, and
scarcity of labeled corpora. To solve the joint problem of code-mixing and
sarcasm detection, we propose the idea of capturing incongruity through
sub-word level embeddings learned via fastText. Empirical results shows that
our proposed model achieves F1-score on code-mix Hinglish dataset comparable to
pretrained multilingual models while training 10x faster and using a lower
memory footprint",Sarcasm Detection,
EVOTER: Evolution of Transparent Explainable Rule-sets,"Most AI systems are black boxes generating reasonable outputs for given
inputs. Some domains, however, have explainability and trustworthiness
requirements that cannot be directly met by these approaches. Various methods
have therefore been developed to interpret black-box models after training.
This paper advocates an alternative approach where the models are transparent
and explainable to begin with. This approach, EVOTER, evolves rule-sets based
on simple logical expressions. The approach is evaluated in several
prediction/classification and prescription/policy search domains with and
without a surrogate. It is shown to discover meaningful rule sets that perform
similarly to black-box models. The rules can provide insight into the domain,
and make biases hidden in the data explicit. It may also be possible to edit
them directly to remove biases and add constraints. EVOTER thus forms a
promising foundation for building trustworthy AI systems for real-world
applications in the future.",Transparent and Explainable Models,

the representation learned by the model being task-specific, and inevitably
result in the lack of generalization ability of the feature based on
multi-modal modeling. More recent studies have shown that establishing
cross-modal relationship between auditory and visual stream is a promising
solution for the challenge of audio-visual multi-task learning. Therefore, as a

Pred&Guide: Labeled Target Class Prediction for Guiding Semi-Supervised Domain Adaptation,"Semi-supervised domain adaptation aims to classify data belonging to a target

which leverages the inconsistency between the predicted and the actual class
labels of the few labeled target examples to effectively guide the domain
adaptation in a semi-supervised setting. Pred&Guide consists of three stages,
as follows (1) First, in order to treat all the target samples equally, we
perform unsupervised domain adaptation coupled with self-training; (2) Second
is the label prediction stage, where the current model is used to predict the
labels of the few labeled target examples, and (3) Finally, the correctness of
the label predictions are used to effectively weigh source examples class-wise
to better guide the domain adaptation process. Extensive experiments show that
the proposed Pred&Guide framework achieves state-of-the-art results for two

Feasibility on Detecting Door Slamming towards Monitoring Early Signs of Domestic Violence,"By using low-cost microcontrollers and TinyML, we investigate the feasibility

this into a convolutional neural network to classify the sample. Under test
conditions, with no background noise, accuracy of 88.89\% was achieved,
declining to 87.50\% when assorted background noises were mixed in at a
relative volume of 0.5 times that of the sample. The model is then deployed on
an Arduino Nano BLE 33 Sense attached to the door, and only begins sampling
once an acceleration greater than a predefined threshold acceleration is

Escaping Data Scarcity for High-Resolution Heterogeneous Face Hallucination,"In Heterogeneous Face Recognition (HFR), the objective is to match faces
across two different domains such as visible and thermal. Large domain
discrepancy makes HFR a difficult problem. Recent methods attempting to fill
the gap via synthesis have achieved promising results, but their performance is
still limited by the scarcity of paired training data. In practice, large-scale
heterogeneous face data are often inaccessible due to the high cost of
acquisition and annotation process as well as privacy regulations. In this
paper, we propose a new face hallucination paradigm for HFR, which not only
enables data-efficient synthesis but also allows to scale up model training
without breaking any privacy policy. Unlike existing methods that learn face
synthesis entirely from scratch, our approach is particularly designed to take
advantage of rich and diverse facial priors from visible domain for more
faithful hallucination. On the other hand, large-scale training is enabled by
introducing a new federated learning scheme to allow institution-wise
collaborations while avoiding explicit data sharing. Extensive experiments
demonstrate the advantages of our approach in tackling HFR under current data
limitations. In a unified framework, our method yields the state-of-the-art

PrivMVMF: Privacy-Preserving Multi-View Matrix Factorization for Recommender Systems,"With an increasing focus on data privacy, there have been pilot studies on
recommender systems in a federated learning (FL) framework, where multiple
parties collaboratively train a model without sharing their data. Most of these
studies assume that the conventional FL framework can fully protect user
privacy. However, there are serious privacy risks in matrix factorization in
federated recommender systems based on our study. This paper first provides a
rigorous theoretical analysis of the server reconstruction attack in four
scenarios in federated recommender systems, followed by comprehensive
experiments. The empirical results demonstrate that the FL server could infer
users' information with accuracy >80% based on the uploaded gradients from FL
nodes. The robustness analysis suggests that our reconstruction attack analysis
outperforms the random guess by >30% under Laplace noises with b no larger than
0.5 for all scenarios. Then, the paper proposes a new privacy-preserving

MulT: An End-to-End Multitask Learning Transformer,"We propose an end-to-end Multitask Learning Transformer framework, named
MulT, to simultaneously learn multiple high-level vision tasks, including depth
estimation, semantic segmentation, reshading, surface normal estimation, 2D
keypoint detection, and edge detection. Based on the Swin transformer model,
our framework encodes the input image into a shared representation and makes
predictions for each vision task using task-specific transformer-based decoder
heads. At the heart of our approach is a shared attention mechanism modeling
the dependencies across the tasks. We evaluate our model on several multitask
benchmarks, showing that our MulT framework outperforms both the state-of-the
art multitask convolutional neural network models and all the respective single
task transformer models. Our experiments further highlight the benefits of
sharing attention across all the tasks, and demonstrate that our MulT model is
robust and generalizes well to new domains. Our project website is at

Do You Really Mean That? Content Driven Audio-Visual Deepfake Dataset and Multimodal Method for Temporal Forgery Localization,"Due to its high societal impact, deepfake detection is getting active
attention in the computer vision community. Most deepfake detection methods
rely on identity, facial attributes, and adversarial perturbation-based
spatio-temporal modifications at the whole video or random locations while
keeping the meaning of the content intact. However, a sophisticated deepfake
may contain only a small segment of video/audio manipulation, through which the
meaning of the content can be, for example, completely inverted from a
sentiment perspective. We introduce a content-driven audio-visual deepfake
dataset, termed Localized Audio Visual DeepFake (LAV-DF), explicitly designed
for the task of learning temporal forgery localization. Specifically, the
content-driven audio-visual manipulations are performed strategically to change
the sentiment polarity of the whole video. Our baseline method for benchmarking
the proposed dataset is a 3DCNN model, termed as Boundary Aware Temporal
Forgery Detection (BA-TFD), which is guided via contrastive, boundary matching,
and frame classification loss functions. Our extensive quantitative and
qualitative analysis demonstrates the proposed method's strong performance for
temporal forgery localization and deepfake detection tasks.",Deepfake Detection,
The Winning Solution to the iFLYTEK Challenge 2021 Cultivated Land Extraction from High-Resolution Remote Sensing Image,"Extracting cultivated land accurately from high-resolution remote images is a
basic task for precision agriculture. This report introduces our solution to
the iFLYTEK challenge 2021 cultivated land extraction from high-resolution
remote sensing image. The challenge requires segmenting cultivated land objects
in very high-resolution multispectral remote sensing images. We established a
highly effective and efficient pipeline to solve this problem. We first divided
the original images into small tiles and separately performed instance
segmentation on each tile. We explored several instance segmentation algorithms
that work well on natural images and developed a set of effective methods that
are applicable to remote sensing images. Then we merged the prediction results
of all small tiles into seamless, continuous segmentation results through our
proposed overlap-tile fusion strategy. We achieved the first place among 486
teams in the challenge.",cultivated land extraction,
M$^2$DQN: A Robust Method for Accelerating Deep Q-learning Network,"Deep Q-learning Network (DQN) is a successful way which combines
reinforcement learning with deep neural networks and leads to a widespread
application of reinforcement learning. One challenging problem when applying
DQN or other reinforcement learning algorithms to real world problem is data
collection. Therefore, how to improve data efficiency is one of the most
important problems in the research of reinforcement learning. In this paper, we
propose a framework which uses the Max-Mean loss in Deep Q-Network (M$^2$DQN).
Instead of sampling one batch of experiences in the training step, we sample
several batches from the experience replay and update the parameters such that
the maximum TD-error of these batches is minimized. The proposed method can be
combined with most of existing techniques of DQN algorithm by replacing the
loss function. We verify the effectiveness of this framework with one of the
most widely used techniques, Double DQN (DDQN), in several gym games. The
results show that our method leads to a substantial improvement in both the
learning speed and performance.",Deep Q-learning Network,
Can You Fool AI by Doing a 180? $\unicode{x2013}$ A Case Study on Authorship Analysis of Texts by Arata Osada,"This paper is our attempt at answering a twofold question covering the areas
of ethics and authorship analysis. Firstly, since the methods used for
performing authorship analysis imply that an author can be recognized by the
content he or she creates, we were interested in finding out whether it would
be possible for an author identification system to correctly attribute works to
authors if in the course of years they have undergone a major psychological
transition. Secondly, and from the point of view of the evolution of an
author's ethical values, we checked what it would mean if the authorship
attribution system encounters difficulties in detecting single authorship. We
set out to answer those questions through performing a binary authorship
analysis task using a text classifier based on a pre-trained transformer model
and a baseline method relying on conventional similarity metrics. For the test
set, we chose works of Arata Osada, a Japanese educator and specialist in the
history of education, with half of them being books written before the World
War II and another half in the 1950s, in between which he underwent a
transformation in terms of political opinions. As a result, we were able to
confirm that in the case of texts authored by Arata Osada in a time span of
more than 10 years, while the classification accuracy drops by a large margin
and is substantially lower than for texts by other non-fiction writers,
confidence scores of the predictions remain at a similar level as in the case
of a shorter time span, indicating that the classifier was in many instances
tricked into deciding that texts written over a time span of multiple years
were actually written by two different people, which in turn leads us to
believe that such a change can affect authorship analysis, and that historical
events have great impact on a person's ethical outlook as expressed in their
writings.",Authorship Identification,

evaluation method that instead prioritizes inclusive AIs, which provably retain
the requisite knowledge not only for subsequent response customization to
particular segments of the population but also for utility-maximizing

Privacy-Preserving Image Classification Using Isotropic Network,"In this paper, we propose a privacy-preserving image classification method
that uses encrypted images and an isotropic network such as the vision

visual information to deep neural networks (DNNs) for both training and testing
but also to maintain a high classification accuracy. In addition, compressible
encrypted images, called encryption-then-compression (EtC) images, can be used
for both training and testing without any adaptation network. Previously, to
classify EtC images, an adaptation network was required before a classification
network, so methods with an adaptation network have been only tested on small
images. To the best of our knowledge, previous privacy-preserving image
classification methods have never considered image compressibility and patch
embedding-based isotropic networks. In an experiment, the proposed
privacy-preserving image classification was demonstrated to outperform
state-of-the-art methods even when EtC images were used in terms of

A Generalized & Robust Framework For Timestamp Supervision in Temporal Action Segmentation,"In temporal action segmentation, Timestamp supervision requires only a
handful of labelled frames per video sequence. For unlabelled frames, previous
works rely on assigning hard labels, and performance rapidly collapses under
subtle violations of the annotation assumptions. We propose a novel
Expectation-Maximization (EM) based approach that leverages the label
uncertainty of unlabelled frames and is robust enough to accommodate possible
annotation errors. With accurate timestamp annotations, our proposed method
produces SOTA results and even exceeds the fully-supervised setup in several
metrics and datasets. When applied to timestamp annotations with missing action
segments, our method presents stable performance. To further test our
formulation's robustness, we introduce the new challenging annotation setup of
Skip-tag supervision. This setup relaxes constraints and requires annotations

Depthformer : Multiscale Vision Transformer For Monocular Depth Estimation With Local Global Information Fusion,"Attention-based models such as transformers have shown outstanding
performance on dense prediction tasks, such as semantic segmentation, owing to
their capability of capturing long-range dependency in an image. However, the
benefit of transformers for monocular depth prediction has seldom been explored
so far. This paper benchmarks various transformer-based models for the depth
estimation task on an indoor NYUV2 dataset and an outdoor KITTI dataset. We
propose a novel attention-based architecture, Depthformer for monocular depth
estimation that uses multi-head self-attention to produce the multiscale
feature maps, which are effectively combined by our proposed decoder network.
We also propose a Transbins module that divides the depth range into bins whose

linear combination of bin centers for each pixel. Transbins module takes
advantage of the global receptive field using the transformer module in the
encoding stage. Experimental results on NYUV2 and KITTI depth estimation

Hierarchical Decomposition and Analysis for Generalized Planning,"This paper presents new methods for analyzing and evaluating generalized
plans that can solve broad classes of related planning problems. Although
synthesis and learning of generalized plans has been a longstanding goal in AI,
it remains challenging due to fundamental gaps in methods for analyzing the
scope and utility of a given generalized plan. This paper addresses these gaps
by developing a new conceptual framework along with proof techniques and
algorithmic processes for assessing termination and goal-reachability related
properties of generalized plans. We build upon classic results from graph
theory to decompose generalized plans into smaller components that are then
used to derive hierarchical termination arguments. These methods can be used to
determine the utility of a given generalized plan, as well as to guide the
synthesis and learning processes for generalized plans. We present theoretical
as well as empirical results illustrating the scope of this new approach. Our
analysis shows that this approach significantly extends the class of
generalized plans that can be assessed automatically, thereby reducing barriers
in the synthesis and learning of reliable generalized plans.",generalized planning analysis,
Deep learning for spatio-temporal forecasting -- application to solar energy,"This thesis tackles the subject of spatio-temporal forecasting with deep
learning. The motivating application at Electricity de France (EDF) is
short-term solar energy forecasting with fisheye images. We explore two main
research directions for improving deep forecasting methods by injecting
external physical knowledge. The first direction concerns the role of the
training loss function. We show that differentiable shape and temporal criteria
can be leveraged to improve the performances of existing models. We address
both the deterministic context with the proposed DILATE loss function and the
probabilistic context with the STRIPE model. Our second direction is to augment
incomplete physical models with deep data-driven networks for accurate
forecasting. For video prediction, we introduce the PhyDNet model that
disentangles physical dynamics from residual information necessary for
prediction, such as texture or details. We further propose a learning framework
(APHYNITY) that ensures a principled and unique linear decomposition between

ReAct: Synergizing Reasoning and Acting in Language Models,"While large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated impressive capabilities
across tasks in language understanding and interactive decision making, their
abilities for reasoning (e.g. chain-of-thought prompting) and acting (e.g.
action plan generation) have primarily been studied as separate topics. In this
paper, we explore the use of LLMs to generate both reasoning traces and
task-specific actions in an interleaved manner, allowing for greater synergy
between the two: reasoning traces help the model induce, track, and update
action plans as well as handle exceptions, while actions allow it to interface
with external sources, such as knowledge bases or environments, to gather
additional information. We apply our approach, named ReAct, to a diverse set of
language and decision making tasks and demonstrate its effectiveness over
state-of-the-art baselines, as well as improved human interpretability and
trustworthiness over methods without reasoning or acting components.
Concretely, on question answering (HotpotQA) and fact verification (Fever),
ReAct overcomes issues of hallucination and error propagation prevalent in
chain-of-thought reasoning by interacting with a simple Wikipedia API, and
generates human-like task-solving trajectories that are more interpretable than
baselines without reasoning traces. On two interactive decision making
benchmarks (ALFWorld and WebShop), ReAct outperforms imitation and

Cyclical Focal Loss,"The cross-entropy softmax loss is the primary loss function used to train
deep neural networks. On the other hand, the focal loss function has been

DePA: Improving Non-autoregressive Machine Translation with Dependency-Aware Decoder,"Non-autoregressive machine translation (NAT) models have lower translation
quality than autoregressive translation (AT) models because NAT decoders do not
depend on previous target tokens in the decoder input. We propose a novel and
general Dependency-Aware Decoder (DePA) to enhance target dependency modeling
in the decoder of fully NAT models from two perspectives: decoder
self-attention and decoder input. First, we propose an autoregressive
forward-backward pre-training phase before NAT training, which enables the NAT
decoder to gradually learn bidirectional target dependencies for the final NAT
training. Second, we transform the decoder input from the source language
representation space to the target language representation space through a
novel attentive transformation process, which enables the decoder to better
capture target dependencies. DePA can be applied to any fully NAT models.
Extensive experiments show that DePA consistently improves highly competitive

requirements. We propose a new method called signed-binary networks to improve
efficiency further (by exploiting both weight sparsity and weight repetition
together) while maintaining similar accuracy. Our method achieves comparable
accuracy on ImageNet and CIFAR10 datasets with binary and can lead to 69%

uncertainty in decision makers' (DMs) preferences, including normal and
triangular distributions, as well as interval preferences. To address
large-scale group MCDM scenarios, a probabilistic mixture model is developed,
enabling the identification of homogeneous subgroups of DMs. Furthermore, a

Analysis & Computational Complexity Reduction of Monocular and Stereo Depth Estimation Techniques,"Accurate depth estimation with lowest compute and energy cost is a crucial
requirement for unmanned and battery operated autonomous systems. Robotic
applications require real time depth estimation for navigation and decision
making under rapidly changing 3D surroundings. A high accuracy algorithm may
provide the best depth estimation but may consume tremendous compute and energy
resources. A general trade-off is to choose less accurate methods for initial
depth estimate and a more accurate yet compute intensive method when needed.
Previous work has shown this trade-off can be improved by developing a
state-of-the-art method (AnyNet) to improve stereo depth estimation.
  We studied both the monocular and stereo vision depth estimation methods and
investigated methods to reduce computational complexity of these methods. This
was our baseline. Consequently, our experiments show reduction of monocular
depth estimation model size by ~75% reduces accuracy by less than 2% (SSIM

Many Ways to Be Lonely: Fine-Grained Characterization of Loneliness and Its Potential Changes in COVID-19,"Loneliness has been associated with negative outcomes for physical and mental
health. Understanding how people express and cope with various forms of
loneliness is critical for early screening and targeted interventions to reduce
loneliness, particularly among vulnerable groups such as young adults. To
examine how different forms of loneliness and coping strategies manifest in
loneliness self-disclosure, we built a dataset, FIG-Loneliness (FIne-Grained

loneliness related forums consisting of a diverse age group. We provided
annotations by trained human annotators for binary and fine-grained loneliness
classifications of the posts. Trained on FIG-Loneliness, two BERT-based models
were used to understand loneliness forms and authors' coping strategies in
these forums. Our binary loneliness classification achieved an accuracy above
97%, and fine-grained loneliness category classification reached an average
accuracy of 77% across all labeled categories. With FIG-Loneliness and model
predictions, we found that loneliness expressions in the young adults related
forums were distinct from other forums. Those in young adult-focused forums
were more likely to express concerns pertaining to peer relationship, and were
potentially more sensitive to geographical isolation impacted by the COVID-19

Tightly Coupled Learning Strategy for Weakly Supervised Hierarchical Place Recognition,"Visual place recognition (VPR) is a key issue for robotics and autonomous
systems. For the trade-off between time and performance, most of methods use
the coarse-to-fine hierarchical architecture, which consists of retrieving
top-N candidates using global features, and re-ranking top-N with local
features. However, since the two types of features are usually processed
independently, re-ranking may harm global retrieval, termed re-ranking
confusion. Moreover, re-ranking is limited by global retrieval. In this paper,
we propose a tightly coupled learning (TCL) strategy to train triplet models.
Different from original triplet learning (OTL) strategy, it combines global and
local descriptors for joint optimization. In addition, a bidirectional search
dynamic time warping (BS-DTW) algorithm is also proposed to mine locally
spatial information tailored to VPR in re-ranking. The experimental results on
public benchmarks show that the models using TCL outperform the models using
OTL, and TCL can be used as a general strategy to improve performance for
weakly supervised ranking tasks. Further, our lightweight unified model is
better than several state-of-the-art methods and has over an order of magnitude

to efficiently extract pairwise similarity relations between labeled source and
unlabeled target domain instances, suited to handle an arbitrary number of
classes. Next, we propose and theoretically justify a novel variant of the
contrastive loss to promote local consistency among within-class cross domain
samples while enforcing separation between classes, thus preserving
discriminative transfer from source to target. We validate the advantages of
MemSAC with significant improvements over previous state-of-the-art on multiple

instructed to translate or post-edit the same set of English documents into
Arabic, Dutch, Italian, Turkish, Ukrainian, and Vietnamese. During the process,
their edits, keystrokes, editing times and pauses were recorded, enabling an
in-depth, cross-lingual evaluation of NMT quality and post-editing
effectiveness. Using this new dataset, we assess the impact of two
state-of-the-art NMT systems, Google Translate and the multilingual mBART-50

faster than translation from scratch. However, the magnitude of productivity
gains varies widely across systems and languages, highlighting major
disparities in post-editing effectiveness for languages at different degrees of
typological relatedness to English, even when controlling for system
architecture and training data size. We publicly release the complete dataset

analysis is how to learn effective visual features for sentiment prediction
since input images are often very diverse. To address this challenge, we
propose a new method that improves visual-textual sentiment analysis by
introducing powerful expert visual features. The proposed method consists of
four parts: (1) a visual-textual branch to learn features directly from data
for sentiment analysis, (2) a visual expert branch with a set of pre-trained
""expert"" encoders to extract effective visual features, (3) a CLIP branch to
implicitly model visual-textual correspondence, and (4) a multimodal feature
fusion network based on either BERT or MLP to fuse multimodal features and make
sentiment prediction. Extensive experiments on three datasets show that our
method produces better visual-textual sentiment analysis performance than
existing methods.",visual-textual sentiment analysis,
PLOT: Prompt Learning with Optimal Transport for Vision-Language Models,"With the increasing attention to large vision-language models such as CLIP,
there has been a significant amount of effort dedicated to building efficient
prompts. Unlike conventional methods of only learning one single prompt, we
propose to learn multiple comprehensive prompts to describe diverse
characteristics of categories such as intrinsic attributes or extrinsic
contexts. However, directly matching each prompt to the same visual feature is
problematic, as it pushes the prompts to converge to one point. To solve this
problem, we propose to apply optimal transport to match the vision and text
modalities. Specifically, we first model images and the categories with visual
and textual feature sets. Then, we apply a two-stage optimization strategy to
learn the prompts. In the inner loop, we optimize the optimal transport
distance to align visual features and prompts by the Sinkhorn algorithm, while
in the outer loop, we learn the prompts by this distance from the supervised
data. Extensive experiments are conducted on the few-shot recognition task and
the improvement demonstrates the superiority of our method. The code is
available at https://github.com/CHENGY12/PLOT.",prompt learning for vision-language models,
Development of an Extractive Clinical Question Answering Dataset with Multi-Answer and Multi-Focus Questions,"Background: Extractive question-answering (EQA) is a useful natural language
processing (NLP) application for answering patient-specific questions by
locating answers in their clinical notes. Realistic clinical EQA can have
multiple answers to a single question and multiple focus points in one
question, which are lacking in the existing datasets for development of
artificial intelligence solutions. Objective: Create a dataset for developing
and evaluating clinical EQA systems that can handle natural multi-answer and
multi-focus questions. Methods: We leveraged the annotated relations from the
2018 National NLP Clinical Challenges (n2c2) corpus to generate an EQA dataset.
Specifically, the 1-to-N, M-to-1, and M-to-N drug-reason relations were
included to form the multi-answer and multi-focus QA entries, which represent
more complex and natural challenges in addition to the basic
one-drug-one-reason cases. A baseline solution was developed and tested on the
dataset. Results: The derived RxWhyQA dataset contains 96,939 QA entries. Among
the answerable questions, 25% require multiple answers, and 2% ask about
multiple drugs within one question. There are frequent cues observed around the
answers in the text, and 90% of the drug and reason terms occur within the same
or an adjacent sentence. The baseline EQA solution achieved a best f1-measure
of 0.72 on the entire dataset, and on specific subsets, it was: 0.93 on the
unanswerable questions, 0.48 on single-drug questions versus 0.60 on multi-drug
questions, 0.54 on the single-answer questions versus 0.43 on multi-answer
questions. Discussion: The RxWhyQA dataset can be used to train and evaluate
systems that need to handle multi-answer and multi-focus questions.
Specifically, multi-answer EQA appears to be challenging and therefore warrants
more investment in research.",Clinical Extractive Question-Answering,
StyleRes: Transforming the Residuals for Real Image Editing with StyleGAN,"We present a novel image inversion framework and a training pipeline to
achieve high-fidelity image inversion with high-quality attribute editing.
Inverting real images into StyleGAN's latent space is an extensively studied
problem, yet the trade-off between the image reconstruction fidelity and image
editing quality remains an open challenge. The low-rate latent spaces are
limited in their expressiveness power for high-fidelity reconstruction. On the
other hand, high-rate latent spaces result in degradation in editing quality.
In this work, to achieve high-fidelity inversion, we learn residual features in
higher latent codes that lower latent codes were not able to encode. This
enables preserving image details in reconstruction. To achieve high-quality
editing, we learn how to transform the residual features for adapting to
manipulations in latent codes. We train the framework to extract residual
features and transform them via a novel architecture pipeline and cycle
consistency losses. We run extensive experiments and compare our method with
state-of-the-art inversion methods. Qualitative metrics and visual comparisons
show significant improvements. Code: https://github.com/hamzapehlivan/StyleRes",image inversion,
Tutorial on amortized optimization,"Optimization is a ubiquitous modeling tool and is often deployed in settings
which repeatedly solve similar instances of the same problem. Amortized
optimization methods use learning to predict the solutions to problems in these
settings, exploiting the shared structure between similar problem instances.
These methods have been crucial in variational inference and reinforcement
learning and are capable of solving optimization problems many orders of
magnitudes times faster than traditional optimization methods that do not use
amortization. This tutorial presents an introduction to the amortized
optimization foundations behind these advancements and overviews their
applications in variational inference, sparse coding, gradient-based
meta-learning, control, reinforcement learning, convex optimization, optimal
transport, and deep equilibrium networks. The source code for this tutorial is
available at

Federated Named Entity Recognition,"We present an analysis of the performance of Federated Learning in a
paradigmatic natural-language processing task: Named-Entity Recognition (NER).
For our evaluation, we use the language-independent CoNLL-2003 dataset as our
benchmark dataset and a Bi-LSTM-CRF model as our benchmark NER model. We show
that federated training reaches almost the same performance as the centralized
model, though with some performance degradation as the learning environments
become more heterogeneous. We also show the convergence rate of federated
models for NER. Finally, we discuss existing challenges of Federated Learning
for NLP applications that can foster future research directions.",Named-Entity Recognition,
Inpainting at Modern Camera Resolution by Guided PatchMatch with Auto-Curation,"Recently, deep models have established SOTA performance for low-resolution
image inpainting, but they lack fidelity at resolutions associated with modern
cameras such as 4K or more, and for large holes. We contribute an inpainting
benchmark dataset of photos at 4K and above representative of modern sensors.
We demonstrate a novel framework that combines deep learning and traditional
methods. We use an existing deep inpainting model LaMa to fill the hole
plausibly, establish three guide images consisting of structure, segmentation,
depth, and apply a multiply-guided PatchMatch to produce eight candidate
upsampled inpainted images. Next, we feed all candidate inpaintings through a
novel curation module that chooses a good inpainting by column summation on an
8x8 antisymmetric pairwise preference matrix. Our framework's results are
overwhelmingly preferred by users over 8 strong baselines, with improvements of
quantitative metrics up to 7.4 over the best baseline LaMa, and our technique
when paired with 4 different SOTA inpainting backbones improves each such that
ours is overwhelmingly preferred by users over a strong super-res baseline.",image inpainting,
Molecular Joint Representation Learning via Multi-modal Information,"In recent years, artificial intelligence has played an important role on
accelerating the whole process of drug discovery. Various of molecular
representation schemes of different modals (e.g. textual sequence or graph) are
developed. By digitally encoding them, different chemical information can be
learned through corresponding network structures. Molecular graphs and
Simplified Molecular Input Line Entry System (SMILES) are popular means for
molecular representation learning in current. Previous works have done attempts
by combining both of them to solve the problem of specific information loss in
single-modal representation on various tasks. To further fusing such
multi-modal imformation, the correspondence between learned chemical feature
from different representation should be considered. To realize this, we propose
a novel framework of molecular joint representation learning via Multi-Modal
information of SMILES and molecular Graphs, called MMSG. We improve the
self-attention mechanism by introducing bond level graph representation as
attention bias in Transformer to reinforce feature correspondence between
multi-modal information. We further propose a Bidirectional Message
Communication Graph Neural Network (BMC GNN) to strengthen the information flow
aggregated from graphs for further combination. Numerous experiments on public
property prediction datasets have demonstrated the effectiveness of our model.",Molecular Representation Learning,
Dynamic Test-Time Augmentation via Differentiable Functions,"Distribution shifts, which often occur in the real world, degrade the
accuracy of deep learning systems, and thus improving robustness is essential
for practical applications. To improve robustness, we study an image
enhancement method that generates recognition-friendly images without
retraining the recognition model. We propose a novel image enhancement method,
DynTTA, which is based on differentiable data augmentation techniques and
generates a blended image from many augmented images to improve the recognition
accuracy under distribution shifts. In addition to standard data augmentations,
DynTTA also incorporates deep neural network-based image transformation, which
further improves the robustness. Because DynTTA is composed of differentiable
functions, it is directly trained with the classification loss of the
recognition model. We experiment with widely used image recognition datasets
using various classification models, including Vision Transformer and
MLP-Mixer. DynTTA improves the robustness with almost no reduction in
classification accuracy for clean images, which is a better result than the
existing methods. Furthermore, we show that estimating the training time
augmentation for distribution-shifted datasets using DynTTA and retraining the
recognition model with the estimated augmentation significantly improves
robustness.",test-time augmentation,
Coordinated Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning for Unmanned Aerial Vehicle Swarms in Autonomous Mobile Access Applications,"This paper proposes a novel centralized training and distributed execution
(CTDE)-based multi-agent deep reinforcement learning (MADRL) method for
multiple unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) control in autonomous mobile access
applications. For the purpose, a single neural network is utilized in
centralized training for cooperation among multiple agents while maximizing the
total quality of service (QoS) in mobile access applications.",Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning,
Mirror-Yolo: An attention-based instance segmentation and detection model for mirrors,"Mirrors can degrade the performance of computer vision models, however to
accurately detect mirrors in images remains challenging. YOLOv4 achieves
phenomenal results both in object detection accuracy and speed, nevertheless
the model often fails in detecting mirrors. In this paper, a novel mirror
detection method `Mirror-YOLO' is proposed, which mainly targets on mirror
detection. Based on YOLOv4, the proposed model embeds an attention mechanism
for better feature acquisition, and a hypercolumn-stairstep approach for
feature map fusion. Mirror-YOLO can also produce accurate bounding polygons for
instance segmentation. The effectiveness of our proposed model is demonstrated
by our experiments, compared to the existing mirror detection methods, the
proposed Mirror-YOLO achieves better performance in detection accuracy on the
mirror image dataset.",mirror detection,
N-ACT: An Interpretable Deep Learning Model for Automatic Cell Type and Salient Gene Identification,"Single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNAseq) is rapidly advancing our understanding
of cellular composition within complex tissues and organisms. A major
limitation in most scRNAseq analysis pipelines is the reliance on manual
annotations to determine cell identities, which are time consuming, subjective,
and require expertise. Given the surge in cell sequencing, supervised
methods-especially deep learning models-have been developed for automatic cell
type identification (ACTI), which achieve high accuracy and scalability.
However, all existing deep learning frameworks for ACTI lack interpretability
and are used as ""black-box"" models. We present N-ACT (Neural-Attention for Cell
Type identification): the first-of-its-kind interpretable deep neural network
for ACTI utilizing neural-attention to detect salient genes for use in
cell-type identification. We compare N-ACT to conventional annotation methods
on two previously manually annotated data sets, demonstrating that N-ACT
accurately identifies marker genes and cell types in an unsupervised manner,
while performing comparably on multiple data sets to current state-of-the-art
model in traditional supervised ACTI.",Cell Type Identification,
Towards Cross-Disaster Building Damage Assessment with Graph Convolutional Networks,"In the aftermath of disasters, building damage maps are obtained using change
detection to plan rescue operations. Current convolutional neural network
approaches do not consider the similarities between neighboring buildings for
predicting the damage. We present a novel graph-based building damage detection
solution to capture these relationships. Our proposed model architecture learns
from both local and neighborhood features to predict building damage.
Specifically, we adopt the sample and aggregate graph convolution strategy to
learn aggregation functions that generalize to unseen graphs which is essential
for alleviating the time needed to obtain predictions for new disasters. Our
experiments on the xBD dataset and comparisons with a classical convolutional
neural network reveal that while our approach is handicapped by class
imbalance, it presents a promising and distinct advantage when it comes to
cross-disaster generalization.",building damage assessment,
Towards Targeted Change Detection with Heterogeneous Remote Sensing Images for Forest Mortality Mapping,"Several generic methods have recently been developed for change detection in
heterogeneous remote sensing data, such as images from synthetic aperture radar
(SAR) and multispectral radiometers. However, these are not well suited to
detect weak signatures of certain disturbances of ecological systems. To
resolve this problem we propose a new approach based on image-to-image
translation and one-class classification (OCC). We aim to map forest mortality
caused by an outbreak of geometrid moths in a sparsely forested forest-tundra
ecotone using multisource satellite images. The images preceding and following
the event are collected by Landsat-5 and RADARSAT-2, respectively. Using a
recent deep learning method for change-aware image translation, we compute
difference images in both satellites' respective domains. These differences are
stacked with the original pre- and post-event images and passed to an OCC
trained on a small sample from the targeted change class. The classifier
produces a credible map of the complex pattern of forest mortality.",Ecological Disturbance Detection,
Video Extrapolation in Space and Time,"Novel view synthesis (NVS) and video prediction (VP) are typically considered
disjoint tasks in computer vision. However, they can both be seen as ways to
observe the spatial-temporal world: NVS aims to synthesize a scene from a new
point of view, while VP aims to see a scene from a new point of time. These two
tasks provide complementary signals to obtain a scene representation, as
viewpoint changes from spatial observations inform depth, and temporal
observations inform the motion of cameras and individual objects. Inspired by
these observations, we propose to study the problem of Video Extrapolation in
Space and Time (VEST). We propose a model that leverages the self-supervision
and the complementary cues from both tasks, while existing methods can only
solve one of them. Experiments show that our method achieves performance better
than or comparable to several state-of-the-art NVS and VP methods on indoor and
outdoor real-world datasets.",video extrapolation,
Recursive Reinforcement Learning,"Recursion is the fundamental paradigm to finitely describe potentially
infinite objects. As state-of-the-art reinforcement learning (RL) algorithms
cannot directly reason about recursion, they must rely on the practitioner's
ingenuity in designing a suitable ""flat"" representation of the environment. The
resulting manual feature constructions and approximations are cumbersome and
error-prone; their lack of transparency hampers scalability. To overcome these
challenges, we develop RL algorithms capable of computing optimal policies in
environments described as a collection of Markov decision processes (MDPs) that
can recursively invoke one another. Each constituent MDP is characterized by
several entry and exit points that correspond to input and output values of
these invocations. These recursive MDPs (or RMDPs) are expressively equivalent
to probabilistic pushdown systems (with call-stack playing the role of the
pushdown stack), and can model probabilistic programs with recursive procedural
calls. We introduce Recursive Q-learning -- a model-free RL algorithm for RMDPs
-- and prove that it converges for finite, single-exit and deterministic
multi-exit RMDPs under mild assumptions.",reinforcement learning,
