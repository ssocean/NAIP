    Given Title: A Survey of Self-Supervised and Few-Shot Object Detection
    Given Abstract: Labeling data is often expensive and time-consuming, especially for tasks such as object detection and instance segmentation, which require dense labeling of the image. While few-shot object detection is about training a model on novel(unseen) object classeswith little data, it still requires prior training onmany labeled examples of base(seen) classes. On the other hand, self-supervisedmethods aimat learning representations fromunlabeled data which transfer well to downstream tasks such as object detection. Combining few-shot and self-supervised object detection is a promising research direction. In this survey, we reviewand characterize themost recent approaches on few-shot and self-supervised object detection. Then, we give our main takeaways and discuss future research directions.

             diffusion models represent a recent emerging topic in computer vision, demonstrating remarkable results 
             in the area of generative modeling. A diffusion model is a deep generative model that is based on two 
             stages, a forward diffusion stage and a reverse diffusion stage. In the forward diffusion stage, 
             the input data is gradually perturbed over several steps by adding Gaussian noise. In the reverse stage, 
             a model is tasked at recovering the original input data by learning to gradually reverse the diffusion 
             process, step by step. Diffusion models are widely appreciated for the quality and diversity of the 
             generated samples, despite their known computational burdens, i.e., low speeds due to the high number of 
             steps involved during sampling. In this survey, we provide a comprehensive review of articles on 
             denoising diffusion models applied in vision, comprising both theoretical and practical contributions in 
             the field. First, we identify and present three generic diffusion modeling frameworks, which are based 
             on denoising diffusion probabilistic models, noise conditioned score networks, and stochastic 
             differential equations. We further discuss the relations between diffusion models and other deep 
             generative models, including variational auto-encoders, generative adversarial networks, energy-based 
             models, autoregressive models and normalizing flows. Then, we introduce a multi-perspective 
             categorization of diffusion models applied in computer vision. Finally, we illustrate the current 
             limitations of diffusion models and envision some interesting directions for future research.'''),

        review of the cryoelectron microscopy as a complex data source
        for the most of the system biology branches, including the most
        perspective non-local approaches known as "localomics" and
        "dynamomics". A brief summary of various cryoelectron microscopy methods and corresponding system biological approaches is given in the text. The above classification can be
        considered as a useful framework for the primary comprehensions about cryoelectron microscopy aims and instrumental
        tools
