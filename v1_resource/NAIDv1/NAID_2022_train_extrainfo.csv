multimodal systems have attracted more and more attention from researchers.
However, how to exploit the independent and complementary information between

fingerprints and finger veins (Fingerprint Finger Veins-Channel Spatial
Attention Fusion Module, FPV-CSAFM). Specifically, for each pair of fingerprint
and finger vein images, we first propose a simple and effective Convolutional
Neural Network (CNN) to extract features. Then, we build a multimodal feature
fusion module (Channel Spatial Attention Fusion Module, CSAFM) to fully fuse
the complementary information between fingerprints and finger veins. Different
from existing fusion strategies, our fusion method can dynamically adjust the
fusion weights according to the importance of different modalities in channel
and spatial dimensions, so as to better combine the information between
different modalities and improve the overall recognition performance. To
evaluate the performance of our method, we conduct a series of experiments on

the Hero and Gang module, to leverage both global and local information to
promote NER. Specifically, the Hero module is composed of a Transformer-based
encoder to maintain the advantage of the self-attention mechanism, and the Gang
module utilizes a multi-window recurrent module to extract local features and

how the field conceptualizes gender both explicitly (e.g. through definitions

range of tasks such as question answering and code generation. On a high level,
given an input, a language model can be used to automatically complete the
sequence in a statistically-likely way. Based on this, users prompt these
models with language instructions or examples, to implement a variety of
downstream tasks. Advanced prompting methods can even imply interaction between
the language model, a user, and external tools such as calculators. However, to
obtain state-of-the-art performance or adapt language models for specific
tasks, complex task- and model-specific programs have to be implemented, which
may still require ad-hoc interaction.
  Based on this, we present the novel idea of Language Model Programming (LMP).
LMP generalizes language model prompting from pure text prompts to an intuitive
combination of text prompting and scripting. Additionally, LMP allows
constraints to be specified over the language model output. This enables easy
adaption to many tasks while abstracting language model internals and providing
high-level semantics.
  To enable LMP, we implement LMQL(short for Language Model Query Language),
which leverages the constraints and control flow from an LMP prompt to generate
an efficient inference procedure that minimizes the number of expensive calls
to the underlying language model.
  We show that LMQL can capture a wide range of state-of-the-art prompting
methods in an intuitive way, especially facilitating interactive flows that are
challenging to implement with existing high-level APIs. Our evaluation shows
that we retain or increase the accuracy on several downstream tasks, while also
significantly reducing the required amount of computation or cost in the case
of pay-to-use APIs (26-85% cost savings).",1,0,0,0,0,0,0.9231,2.0,0.666309,41

challenge in robotics, with a variety of methods from model-based control to
model-free reinforcement learning having been previously explored in

from demonstrations in dexterous manipulation is quite challenging. The
complex, high-dimensional action-space involved with multi-finger control often
leads to poor sample efficiency of learning-based methods. In this work, we
propose 'Dexterous Imitation Made Easy' (DIME) a new imitation learning
framework for dexterous manipulation. DIME only requires a single RGB camera to
observe a human operator and teleoperate our robotic hand. Once demonstrations
are collected, DIME employs standard imitation learning methods to train
dexterous manipulation policies. On both simulation and real robot benchmarks
we demonstrate that DIME can be used to solve complex, in-hand manipulation

no missing frequency components in node features. We also establish a

field for estimating the motion of all points in a multiview setting. Modeling
the motion from a dynamic scene with multiview data is challenging due to the
ambiguities in points of similar color and points with time-varying color. We
propose to regularize the estimated motion to be predictable. If the motion
from previous frames is known, then the motion in the near future should be
predictable. Therefore, we introduce a predictability regularization by first
conditioning the estimated motion on latent embeddings, then by adopting a
predictor network to enforce predictability on the embeddings. The proposed
framework PREF (Predictability REgularized Fields) achieves on par or better
results than state-of-the-art neural motion field-based dynamic scene

their application in production processes difficult: (i) impossibility or long

happen) and (ii) high cost of experts to label all acquired data. Another
limitating factor for the applicability of AI approaches in this context is the
lack of interpretability of the models (black-boxes), which reduces the

predict the neural skeleton points and another one to produce the connectivity
of these points. We finally generate the target SWC file through the
interpretation of the predicted point coordinates, radius, and connections.

ambiguous, and we need a sentence to define the type semantics accurately. To
model the definition semantics, we use two separate transformer models to
project the contextualized event mentions and corresponding definitions into

contrastive learning. On top of that, we also propose a warming phase to help
the model learn the minor difference between similar definitions. We name our

Second, the extraction for different types of entities is isolated, ignoring
the dependencies between them. Third, query construction relies on external
knowledge and is difficult to apply to realistic scenarios with hundreds of
entity types. To deal with them, we propose Parallel Instance Query Network
(PIQN), which sets up global and learnable instance queries to extract entities
from a sentence in a parallel manner. Each instance query predicts one entity,

in parallel. Instead of being constructed from external knowledge, instance
queries can learn their different query semantics during training. For training

information retrieval that aims to extract a set of phrases with important
information from a source document. Identifying important keyphrase is the
central component of the keyphrase extraction task, and its main challenge is
how to represent information comprehensively and discriminate importance
accurately. In this paper, to address these issues, we design a new hyperbolic
matching model (HyperMatch) to represent phrases and documents in the same
hyperbolic space and explicitly estimate the phrase-document relevance via the
Poincar\'e distance as the important score of each phrase. Specifically, to
capture the hierarchical syntactic and semantic structure information,
HyperMatch takes advantage of the hidden representations in multiple layers of
RoBERTa and integrates them as the word embeddings via an adaptive mixing
layer. Meanwhile, considering the hierarchical structure hidden in the
document, HyperMatch embeds both phrases and documents in the same hyperbolic
space via a hyperbolic phrase encoder and a hyperbolic document encoder. This
strategy can further enhance the estimation of phrase-document relevance due to
the good properties of hyperbolic space. In this setting, the keyphrase
extraction can be taken as a matching problem and effectively implemented by
minimizing a hyperbolic margin-based triplet loss. Extensive experiments are
conducted on six benchmarks and demonstrate that HyperMatch outperforms the

retrieve candidate sentences, then re-rank the candidates with a ranker.
However, the candidates returned by their ranker may not be the most relevant
sentences, since the ranker treats all candidates equally without considering
their relevance to the reference sentences of the given concepts. Another
problem is that re-ranking is very expensive, but only using retrievers will
seriously degrade the performance of their generation models. To solve these
problems, we propose the metric distillation rule to distill knowledge from the
metric (e.g., BLEU) to the ranker. We further transfer the critical knowledge

contextual style and semantic layout, and then generates two fused modulation

analysis. Most existing works draw inspiration from image object detection and
tend to reformulate it as a proposal generation - classification problem.

equipped with annotated labels, which have to be empirically compiled, thus the
information in the annotations is not necessarily precisely employed in the
model training process. Second, there are large variations in the temporal
scale of actions, and neglecting this fact may lead to deficient representation
in the video features. To address these issues and precisely model temporal
action detection, we formulate the task of temporal action detection in a novel
perspective of semantic segmentation. Owing to the 1-dimensional property of
TAD, we are able to convert the coarse-grained detection annotations to
fine-grained semantic segmentation annotations for free. We take advantage of

Accuracy (JGA) defined as the fraction of turns where the ground-truth dialogue
state exactly matches the prediction. Generally in DST, the dialogue state or
belief state for a given turn contains all the intents shown by the user till
that turn. Due to this cumulative nature of the belief state, it is difficult
to get a correct prediction once a misprediction has occurred. Thus, although
being a useful metric, it can be harsh at times and underestimate the true
potential of a DST model. Moreover, an improvement in JGA can sometimes
decrease the performance of turn-level or non-cumulative belief state
prediction due to inconsistency in annotations. So, using JGA as the only
metric for model selection may not be ideal for all scenarios. In this work, we
discuss various evaluation metrics used for DST along with their shortcomings.

respond to trip requests that arrive in real-time, which entails solving hard
combinatorial and sequential decision-making problems under uncertainty. To
avoid decisions that lead to significant inefficiency in the long term,
vehicles should be allocated to requests by optimizing a non-myopic utility
function or by batching requests together and optimizing a myopic utility
function. While the former approach is typically offline, the latter can be
performed online. We point out two major issues with such approaches when
applied to paratransit services in practice. First, it is difficult to batch
paratransit requests together as they are temporally sparse. Second, the
environment in which transit agencies operate changes dynamically (e.g.,
traffic conditions), causing estimates that are learned offline to become
stale. To address these challenges, we propose a fully online approach to solve
the dynamic vehicle routing problem (DVRP) with time windows and stochastic
trip requests that is robust to changing environmental dynamics by
construction. We focus on scenarios where requests are relatively sparse - our

actions for any given state. Accounting for stochastic requests while
optimizing a non-myopic utility function is computationally challenging;
indeed, the action space for such a problem is intractably large in practice.

valid information about possibly correct, though labeled unlikely, joint
locations, we propose to represent the heatmaps as a set of 2D joint candidate
samples. To extract information about the original distribution from these

information about themselves. While the action of sharing is simple, it
requires an elaborate thought process on privacy: what to share, with whom to
share, and for what purposes. Thinking about these for each piece of content to
be shared is tedious. Recent approaches to tackle this problem build personal
assistants that can help users by learning what is private over time and
recommending privacy labels such as private or public to individual content
that a user considers sharing. However, privacy is inherently ambiguous and
highly personal. Existing approaches to recommend privacy decisions do not

able to assess when its recommendation would be uncertain and let the user make

that uses evidential deep learning to classify content based on its privacy
label. An important characteristic of the personal assistant is that it can
model its uncertainty in its decisions explicitly, determine that it does not
know the answer, and delegate from making a recommendation when its uncertainty
is high. By factoring in the user's own understanding of privacy, such as risk
factors or own labels, the personal assistant can personalize its

observation from the findings section and is the most important section for
radiologists to communicate to physicians. Summarizing findings is
time-consuming and can be prone to error for inexperienced radiologists, and
thus automatic impression generation has attracted substantial attention. With
the encoder-decoder framework, most previous studies explore incorporating
extra knowledge (e.g., static pre-defined clinical ontologies or extra
background information). Yet, they encode such knowledge by a separate encoder
to treat it as an extra input to their models, which is limited in leveraging
their relations with the original findings. To address the limitation, we
propose a unified framework for exploiting both extra knowledge and the
original findings in an integrated way so that the critical information (i.e.,
key words and their relations) can be extracted in an appropriate way to
facilitate impression generation. In detail, for each input findings, it is
encoded by a text encoder, and a graph is constructed through its entities and
dependency tree. Then, a graph encoder (e.g., graph neural networks (GNNs)) is
adopted to model relation information in the constructed graph. Finally, to
emphasize the key words in the findings, contrastive learning is introduced to
map positive samples (constructed by masking non-key words) closer and push
apart negative ones (constructed by masking key words). The experimental

Our key observation is that raindrops attached to a glass window yield
noticeable disparities in DP's left-half and right-half images, while almost no
disparity exists for in-focus backgrounds. Therefore, DP disparities can be
utilized for robust raindrop detection. The DP disparities also brings the
advantage that the occluded background regions by raindrops are shifted between

embedding approach performs on the task at hand. Still, it is hardly evaluated

approaches are actually learning to represent.

main message of this paper is that current frozen-model techniques such as
prompt tuning are only the tip of the iceberg, and more powerful methods for
leveraging frozen LMs can do just as well as fine tuning in challenging domains

each node of the tree, simultaneous feature decoding and shape decomposition
are carried out by their respective feature and part decoders, with weight
sharing across the same hierarchy level. As an implicit field decoder, the part
decoder is designed to decompose a sub-shape, via a two-way branched
reconstruction, where each branch predicts a set of parameters defining a
Gaussian to serve as a local point distribution for shape reconstruction. With
reconstruction losses accounted for at each hierarchy level and a decomposition
loss at each node, our network training does not require any ground-truth

simple depth-first backtracking approach, this kind of solver learns the reason
behind occurring conflicts in the form of additional clauses. However, despite
the enormous success of CDCL solvers, there is still only a limited
understanding of what influences the performance of these solvers in what way.
  Considering different measures, this paper demonstrates, quite surprisingly,
that clause learning (without being able to get rid of some clauses) can not
only help the solver but can oftentimes deteriorate the solution process
dramatically. By conducting extensive empirical analysis, we furthermore find
that the runtime distributions of CDCL solvers are multimodal. This
multimodality can be seen as a reason for the deterioration phenomenon
described above. Simultaneously, it also gives an indication of why clause
learning in combination with clause deletion is virtually the de facto standard
of SAT solving, in spite of this phenomenon. As a final contribution, we show
that Weibull mixture distributions can accurately describe the multimodal

plex model has been useful for representing emotions according to valence and

large number of synsets (groups of synonyms in WordNet) using semi-supervised
learning. However, when assigning the level of arousal, the existing method
proposed for SentiWordNet reduces the accuracy of sentiment prediction. In this
paper, we propose a block-segmentation vector for predicting the arousal levels
of many synsets from a small number of labeled words using semi-supervised
learning. We analyze the distribution of arousal and non-arousal words in a
corpus of sentences by comparing it with the distribution of valence words. We
address the problem that arousal level prediction fails when arousal and
non-arousal words are mixed together in some sentences. To capture the features
of such arousal and non-arousal words, we generate word vectors based on
inverted indexes by block IDs, where the corpus is divided into blocks in the

adjacent layers' parameters could compensate layer-wise errors better. In this

argue that prior results are also compatible with a reading process that is at
least partially anticipatory: Readers could make predictions about a future
word and allocate time to process it based on their expectation. In this work,
we operationalize this anticipation as a word's contextual entropy. We assess
the effect of anticipation on reading by comparing how well surprisal and
contextual entropy predict reading times on four naturalistic reading datasets:
two self-paced and two eye-tracking. Experimentally, across datasets and
analyses, we find substantial evidence for effects of contextual entropy over
surprisal on a word's reading time (RT): in fact, entropy is sometimes better
than surprisal in predicting a word's RT. Spillover effects, however, are
generally not captured by entropy, but only by surprisal. Further, we

prerequisite to language understanding. While contextualised language models
are reportedly capable of predicting such commonsense properties with
human-level accuracy, we argue that such results have been inflated because of
the high similarity between training and test concepts. This means that models
which capture concept similarity can perform well, even if they do not capture
any knowledge of the commonsense properties themselves. In settings where there
is no overlap between the properties that are considered during training and
testing, we find that the empirical performance of standard language models
drops dramatically. To address this, we study the possibility of fine-tuning
language models to explicitly model concepts and their properties. In
particular, we train separate concept and property encoders on two types of
readily available data: extracted hyponym-hypernym pairs and generic sentences.
Our experimental results show that the resulting encoders allow us to predict

long-term time series forecasting (LTSF) task. Despite the growing performance
over the past few years, we question the validity of this line of research in
this work. Specifically, Transformers is arguably the most successful solution
to extract the semantic correlations among the elements in a long sequence.
However, in time series modeling, we are to extract the temporal relations in
an ordered set of continuous points. While employing positional encoding and
using tokens to embed sub-series in Transformers facilitate preserving some
ordering information, the nature of the \emph{permutation-invariant}
self-attention mechanism inevitably results in temporal information loss. To
validate our claim, we introduce a set of embarrassingly simple one-layer
linear models named LTSF-Linear for comparison. Experimental results on nine
real-life datasets show that LTSF-Linear surprisingly outperforms existing
sophisticated Transformer-based LTSF models in all cases, and often by a large
margin. Moreover, we conduct comprehensive empirical studies to explore the
impacts of various design elements of LTSF models on their temporal relation
extraction capability. We hope this surprising finding opens up new research
directions for the LTSF task. We also advocate revisiting the validity of
Transformer-based solutions for other time series analysis tasks (e.g., anomaly
detection) in the future. Code is available at:

have been studying multiple ways to generate code comments automatically,
previous work mainly considers representing a code token in its entirety
semantics form only (e.g., a language model is used to learn the semantics of a
code token), and additional code properties such as the tree structure of a
code are included as an auxiliary input to the model. There are two
limitations: 1) Learning the code token in its entirety form may not be able to
capture information succinctly in source code, and 2) The code token does not
contain additional syntactic information, inherently important in programming
languages.
  In this paper, we present LAnguage Model and Named Entity Recognition

effectively and capturing the structural property of a code token. A
character-level language model is used to learn the semantic representation to
encode a code token. For the structural property of a token, a Named Entity
Recognition model is trained to learn the different types of code tokens. These
representations are then fed into an encoder-decoder architecture to generate
code comments. We evaluate the generated comments from LAMNER and other
baselines on a popular Java dataset with four commonly used metrics. Our

computational resources for natural language processing (NLP). Similar to other
languages, Bengali social media contents also include images along with texts

Facebook). Therefore, only the textual data is not enough to judge them since
images might give extra context to make a proper judgement. This paper is about
hate speech detection from multimodal Bengali memes and texts. We prepared the

representation from the unmasked subset is trained to predict that from the

required to capture informative variations in an image. The paper makes three

high false-positive rate. The high false-positive rate is the reason why
anomaly IDS is not commonly applied in practice. Because anomaly-based models
classify an unseen pattern as a threat where it may be normal but not included

the strong language modeling capability of Pre-trained Language Models (PLMs).

empirical studies we argue that this assumption may not hold, and an important
reason for catastrophic forgetting is that the learned representations do not
have good robustness against the appearance of analogous relations in the
subsequent learning process. To address this issue, we encourage the model to

the key quality aspects, generalization, is concerned with measuring the degree
of overfitting of a process model w.r.t. an event log, since the recorded
behavior is just an example of the true behavior of the underlying business
process. Existing generalization measures exhibit several shortcomings that
severely hinder their applicability in practice. For example, they assume the
event log fully fits the discovered process model, and cannot deal with large
real-life event logs and complex process models. More significantly, current
measures neglect generalizations for clear patterns that demand a certain
construct in the model. For example, a repeating sequence in an event log
should be generalized with a loop structure in the model. We address these
shortcomings by proposing a framework of measures that generalize a set of
patterns discovered from an event log with representative traces and check the
corresponding control-flow structures in the process model via their trace
alignment. We instantiate the framework with a generalization measure that uses
tandem repeats to identify repetitive patterns that are compared to the loop
structures and a concurrency oracle to identify concurrent patterns that are
compared to the parallel structures of the process model. In an extensive

measure consistently ranks process models that fulfil the observed patterns

semantic change, which is one of the essential phenomena of natural languages.

podcast transcripts is of practical benefit to both content providers and
consumers. It helps consumers to quickly decide whether they will listen to the
podcasts and reduces the cognitive load of content providers to write

including factual inconsistencies with respect to the inputs. The problem is
exacerbated by speech disfluencies and recognition errors in transcripts of
spoken language. In this paper, we explore a novel abstractive summarization
method to alleviate these challenges. Specifically, our approach learns to
produce an abstractive summary while grounding summary segments in specific
portions of the transcript to allow for full inspection of summary details. We
conduct a series of analyses of the proposed approach on a large podcast

CSSR replaces prototype points with manifolds represented by class-specific

on an individual AE manifold, and measures class belongingness through AE's
reconstruction error. Class-specific AEs are plugged into the top of the DNN
backbone and reconstruct the semantic representations learned by the DNN
instead of the raw image. Through end-to-end learning, the DNN and the AEs
boost each other to learn both discriminative and representative information.

naively memorise local co-occurrence statistics, they thus naturally would
learn a biased view of the physical world. While prior studies have repeatedly
verified that LMs of smaller scales (e.g., RoBERTa, GPT-2) amplify reporting
bias, it remains unknown whether such trends continue when models are scaled
up. We investigate reporting bias from the perspective of colour in larger

the typical colour of objects, which is one simple type of perceptually
grounded physical common sense. Surprisingly, we find that LLMs significantly
outperform smaller LMs in determining an object's typical colour and more
closely track human judgments, instead of overfitting to surface patterns

facts contained in a temporal KG, which records entity relations and when they

listener's probabilistic prior beliefs, something which is captured by one
currently influential model of pragmatics, the Rational Speech Act (RSA)
framework. In this paper we focus on cases when this sensitivity to priors
leads to counterintuitive predictions of the framework. Our domain of interest
is exhaustivity effects, whereby a sentence such as ""Mary came"" is understood
to mean that only Mary came. We show that in the baseline RSA model, under
certain conditions, anti-exhaustive readings are predicted (e.g., ""Mary came""
would be used to convey that both Mary and Peter came). The specific question
we ask is the following: should exhaustive interpretations be derived as purely
pragmatic inferences (as in the classical Gricean view, endorsed in the
baseline RSA model), or should they rather be generated by an encapsulated
semantic mechanism (as argued in some of the recent formal literature)? To
answer this question, we provide a detailed theoretical analysis of different
RSA models and evaluate them against data obtained in a new study which tested
the effects of prior beliefs on both production and comprehension, improving on
previous empirical work. We found no anti-exhaustivity effects, but observed
that message choice is sensitive to priors, as predicted by the RSA framework
overall. The best models turn out to be those which include an encapsulated
exhaustivity mechanism (as other studies concluded on the basis of very
different data). We conclude that, on the one hand, in the division of labor
between semantics and pragmatics, semantics plays a larger role than is often
thought, but, on the other hand, the tradeoff between informativity and cost
which characterizes all RSA models does play a central role for genuine

the effect of removing position encodings on the pre-training objective itself

position information from co-occurrences alone. We do so by controlling the
amount of masked tokens in the input sentence, as a proxy to affect the
importance of position information for the task. We find that the necessity of
position information increases with the amount of masking, and that masked

language generation (NLG) tasks are of critical importance, while understudied.
Approaching natural language understanding (NLU) tasks as NLG achieves
satisfying performance in the general domain through constrained language
generation or language prompting. We emphasize the lack of in-domain generative
language models and the unsystematic generative downstream benchmarks in the
biomedical domain, hindering the development of the research community. In this
work, we introduce the generative language model BioBART that adapts BART to
the biomedical domain. We collate various biomedical language generation tasks
including dialogue, summarization, entity linking, and named entity
recognition. BioBART pretrained on PubMed abstracts has enhanced performance
compared to BART and set strong baselines on several tasks. Furthermore, we

formalisms -- theoretical agents we may analyse or attempt to build. AIXI
appears to be the only such formalism supported by proof that its behaviour is
optimal, a consequence of its use of compression as a proxy for intelligence.
Unfortunately, AIXI is incomputable and claims regarding its behaviour highly
subjective. We argue that this is because AIXI formalises cognition as taking
place in isolation from the environment in which goals are pursued (Cartesian
dualism). We propose an alternative, supported by proof and experiment, which
overcomes these problems. Integrating research from cognitive science with AI,
we formalise an enactive model of learning and reasoning to address the problem
of subjectivity. This allows us to formulate a different proxy for
intelligence, called weakness, which addresses the problem of incomputability.
We prove optimal behaviour is attained when weakness is maximised. This proof
is supplemented by experimental results comparing weakness and description
length (the closest analogue to compression possible without reintroducing
subjectivity). Weakness outperforms description length, suggesting it is a
better proxy. Furthermore we show that, if cognition is enactive, then
minimisation of description length is neither necessary nor sufficient to
attain optimal performance, undermining the notion that compression is closely
related to intelligence. However, there remain open questions regarding the
implementation of scale-able AGI. In the short term, these results may be best

in modern societies, especially in the western world, where platforms such as
Twitter allow users to follow politicians, thus making citizens more involved

their opinions, debate among others on current topics and promote their
political agendas aiming to influence voter behaviour. In this paper, we
attempt to analyse tweets of politicians from three European countries and
explore the virality of their tweets. Previous studies have shown that tweets
conveying negative sentiment are likely to be retweeted more frequently. By
utilising state-of-the-art pre-trained language models, we performed sentiment
analysis on hundreds of thousands of tweets collected from members of
parliament in Greece, Spain and the United Kingdom, including devolved
administrations. We achieved this by systematically exploring and analysing the
differences between influential and less popular tweets. Our analysis indicates
that politicians' negatively charged tweets spread more widely, especially in

practice. We attribute this low performance to the over-parameterization of
PLMs with millions of parameters. To alleviate it, we propose PromCSE

unprecedented attention for their impressive representation learning ability.
However, the pretext task, Masked Image Modeling (MIM), reconstructs the
missing local patches, lacking the global understanding of the image. This
paper extends MAE to a fully supervised setting by adding a supervised
classification branch, thereby enabling MAE to learn global features from
golden labels effectively. The proposed Supervised MAE (SupMAE) only exploits a
visible subset of image patches for classification, unlike the standard
supervised pre-training where all image patches are used. Through experiments,
we demonstrate that SupMAE is not only more training efficient but it also
learns more robust and transferable features. Specifically, SupMAE achieves
comparable performance with MAE using only 30% of compute when evaluated on
ImageNet with the ViT-B/16 model. SupMAE's robustness on ImageNet variants and
transfer learning performance outperforms MAE and standard supervised
pre-training counterparts. Codes are available at

Assimilation Model, which appeals to a mental classification of sounds into
native phoneme categories, versus the idea that rich, fine-grained phonetic
representations tuned to the statistics of the native language, are sufficient.
We operationalize this idea using representations from two state-of-the-art
speech models, a Dirichlet process Gaussian mixture model and the more recent
wav2vec 2.0 model. We present a new, open dataset of French- and
English-speaking participants' speech perception behaviour for 61 vowel sounds

than fine-grained phonetic modelling, both for the discrimination behaviour as
a whole, and for predicting differences in discriminability associated with
differences in native language background. We also show that wav2vec 2.0, while
not good at capturing the effects of native language on speech perception, is
complementary to information about native phoneme assimilation, and provides a
good model of low-level phonetic representations, supporting the idea that both

and cyclical, from the instance-view. Despite these various structures in KGs,
most recent works on embedding KGs assume that the entire KG belongs to only

new hidden state that contains fewer artifacts from the hidden state pool, we
devise a Selective Cross Attention (SCA) module, in which the attention between

transportation and environmental monitoring. One of the fundamental problems
for time series analysis is time series forecasting. Despite the success of
recent deep time series forecasting methods, they require sufficient
observation of historical values to make accurate forecasting. In other words,
the ratio of the output length (or forecasting horizon) to the sum of the input
and output lengths should be low enough (e.g., 0.3). As the ratio increases
(e.g., to 0.8), the uncertainty for the forecasting accuracy increases
significantly. In this paper, we show both theoretically and empirically that
the uncertainty could be effectively reduced by retrieving relevant time series
as references. In the theoretical analysis, we first quantify the uncertainty
and show its connections to the Mean Squared Error (MSE). Then we prove that
models with references are easier to learn than models without references since
the retrieved references could reduce the uncertainty. To empirically
demonstrate the effectiveness of the retrieval based time series forecasting

task for contextualized word embeddings (CWEs). VAST uses valence, the
association of a word with pleasantness, to measure the correspondence of
word-level LM semantics with widely used human judgments, and examines the
effects of contextualization, tokenization, and LM-specific geometry. Because
prior research has found that CWEs from GPT-2 perform poorly on other intrinsic
evaluations, we select GPT-2 as our primary subject, and include results
showing that VAST is useful for 7 other LMs, and can be used in 7 languages.
GPT-2 results show that the semantics of a word incorporate the semantics of
context in layers closer to model output, such that VAST scores diverge between
our contextual settings, ranging from Pearson's rho of .55 to .77 in layer 11.
We also show that multiply tokenized words are not semantically encoded until
layer 8, where they achieve Pearson's rho of .46, indicating the presence of an
encoding process for multiply tokenized words which differs from that of singly
tokenized words, for which rho is highest in layer 0. We find that a few
neurons with values having greater magnitude than the rest mask word-level
semantics in GPT-2's top layer, but that word-level semantics can be recovered
by nullifying non-semantic principal components: Pearson's rho in the top layer
improves from .32 to .76. After isolating semantics, we show the utility of
VAST for understanding LM semantics via improvements over related work on four
word similarity tasks, with a score of .50 on SimLex-999, better than the
previous best of .45 for GPT-2. Finally, we show that 8 of 10 WEAT bias tests,

Observable Markov Decision Processes (POMDPs) offer a formal framework to solve

evolution of the structural condition under deterioration or corrective actions
and, secondly, the non-trivial task of recovery of the observation process
parameters from available monitoring data. Despite these potential challenges,
the adopted POMDP models do not typically account for uncertainty on model
parameters, leading to solutions which can be unrealistically confident. In

effort involved in prompt-design, we instead ask whether producing multiple
effective, yet imperfect, prompts and aggregating them can lead to a high
quality prompting strategy. Our observations motivate our proposed prompting
method, ASK ME ANYTHING (AMA). We first develop an understanding of the
effective prompt formats, finding that question-answering (QA) prompts, which
encourage open-ended generation (""Who went to the park?"") tend to outperform
those that restrict the model outputs (""John went to the park. Output True or

to the effective QA format. We apply the collected prompts to obtain several
noisy votes for the input's true label. We find that the prompts can have very
different accuracies and complex dependencies and thus propose to use weak

final predictions for the inputs. We evaluate AMA across open-source model

health. Evictions are associated with a cascade of negative events that can
lead to unemployment, housing insecurity/homelessness, long-term poverty, and
mental health problems. In this study, we developed a natural language
processing system to automatically detect eviction status from electronic
health record (EHR) notes.
  Materials and Methods: We first defined eviction status (eviction presence
and eviction period) and then annotated eviction status in 5000 EHR notes from
the Veterans Health Administration (VHA). We developed a novel model, KIRESH,
that has shown to substantially outperform other state-of-the-art models such
as fine-tuning pre-trained language models like BioBERT and BioClinicalBERT.
Moreover, we designed a novel prompt to further improve the model performance
by using the intrinsic connection between the two sub-tasks of eviction
presence and period prediction. Finally, we used the Temperature Scaling-based
Calibration on our KIRESH-Prompt method to avoid over-confidence issues arising
from the imbalance dataset.
  Results: KIRESH-Prompt substantially outperformed strong baseline models
including fine-tuning the BioClinicalBERT model to achieve 0.74672 MCC, 0.71153
Macro-F1, and 0.83396 Micro-F1 in predicting eviction period and 0.66827 MCC,
0.62734 Macro-F1, and 0.7863 Micro-F1 in predicting eviction presence. We also
conducted additional experiments on a benchmark social determinants of health
(SBDH) dataset to demonstrate the generalizability of our methods.
  Conclusion and Future Work: KIRESH-Prompt has substantially improved eviction
status classification. We plan to deploy KIRESH-Prompt to the VHA EHRs as an

cues for making predictions. Specifically, we find that when the relative
positions in a training set are biased, the performance on examples with
relative positions unseen during training is significantly degraded. To
mitigate the performance degradation for unseen relative positions, we propose
an ensemble-based debiasing method that does not require prior knowledge about

fine-tuning with AdamW performs substantially better than SGD on modern Vision

reliable prediction of segmentation mask. A fundamental limitation of FM is the
inability to preserve the fine-grained spatial details that affect the accuracy
of segmentation mask, especially for small target objects. In this paper, we
develop a simple, effective, and efficient approach to enhance feature masking
(FM). We dub the enhanced FM as hybrid masking (HM). Specifically, we
compensate for the loss of fine-grained spatial details in FM technique by
investigating and leveraging a complementary basic input masking method.

image content but lacks an accessible representation of object structure. The
second, DINO (Caron et al. 2021), captures the spatial extent of objects but

CLIP to construct category-specific archives of images. These images are
pseudo-labelled with a category-agnostic salient object detector bootstrapped
from DINO, then refined by category-specific segmenters using the CLIP archive
labels. Thanks to the high quality of the refined masks, we show that a
standard segmentation architecture trained on these archives with appropriate

able to answer queries related to both previously and newly indexed documents.
Across different model scales and document identifier representations, we show

phonetic characteristics by the query-key dot product, which is designed to
compute the pairwise relationship between frames. In this paper, we propose a
variant of SA to extract more representative phonetic features. The proposed
phonetic self-attention (phSA) is composed of two different types of phonetic
attention; one is similarity-based and the other is content-based. In short,
similarity-based attention captures the correlation between frames while
content-based attention only considers each frame without being affected by
other frames. We identify which parts of the original dot product equation are
related to two different attention patterns and improve each part with simple
modifications. Our experiments on phoneme classification and speech recognition
show that replacing SA with phSA for lower layers improves the recognition
performance without increasing the latency and the parameter size.",0,0,0,0,0,0,0.51182,4.0,0.514495,29

with one or multiple metrics together with a way to aggregate different systems
performances. They are instrumental in (i) assessing the progress of new
methods along different axes and (ii) selecting the best systems for practical
use. This is particularly the case for NLP with the development of large
pre-trained models (e.g. GPT, BERT) that are expected to generalize well on a

and metrics, there has been little interest in the aggregation procedure, which
is often reduced to a simple average over various performance measures.
However, this procedure can be problematic when the metrics are on a different
scale, which may lead to spurious conclusions. This paper proposes a new
procedure to rank systems based on their performance across different tasks.
Motivated by the social choice theory, the final system ordering is obtained
through aggregating the rankings induced by each task and is theoretically

quantum computers. To achieve this, the distributional meaning of words is
extended by the compositional meaning of sentences (DisCoCat model) : the
vectors representing words' meanings are composed through the syntactic
structure of the sentence. This is done using an algorithm based on tensor
products. We see that this algorithm is inefficient on classical computers but
scales well using quantum circuits. After exposing the practical details of its

Supervised approaches have pushed performance improvement on style-oriented

scarcity of large-scale parallel data in many domains. While unsupervised
approaches do not rely on annotated sentence pairs for each style, they are
often plagued with instability issues such as mode collapse or quality
degradation. To take advantage of both supervised and unsupervised paradigms
and tackle the challenges, in this work, we propose a semi-supervised framework
for text style transfer. First, the learning process is bootstrapped with
supervision guided by automatically constructed pseudo-parallel pairs using
lexical and semantic-based methods. Then the model learns from unlabeled data
via reinforcement rewards. Specifically, we propose to improve the
sequence-to-sequence policy gradient via stepwise reward optimization,
providing fine-grained learning signals and stabilizing the reinforced learning

introduce noise and deteriorate the performance. In this paper, we propose a
novel model named AutoAttention, which includes all item/user/context side

behavior fields and query fields. Pruning on these field pairs via these
learnable weights lead to automatic field pair selection, so as to identify and

intermediate reasoning steps. Providing these steps for prompting
demonstrations is called chain-of-thought (CoT) prompting. CoT prompting has
two major paradigms. One leverages a simple prompt like ""Let's think step by
step"" to facilitate step-by-step thinking before answering a question. The
other uses a few manual demonstrations one by one, each composed of a question
and a reasoning chain that leads to an answer. The superior performance of the
second paradigm hinges on the hand-crafting of task-specific demonstrations one
by one. We show that such manual efforts may be eliminated by leveraging LLMs
with the ""Let's think step by step"" prompt to generate reasoning chains for
demonstrations one by one, i.e., let's think not just step by step, but also
one by one. However, these generated chains often come with mistakes. To
mitigate the effect of such mistakes, we find that diversity matters for
automatically constructing demonstrations. We propose an automatic CoT
prompting method: Auto-CoT. It samples questions with diversity and generates

knowledge, which has high coverage at the cost of interpretability,
controllability, and efficiency. The opposite properties arise in other methods

recent work has demonstrated the effectiveness of storing and retrieving from
an index of Q-A pairs derived from text \citep{lewis2021paq}. This approach

Typically, these methods are constructed upon premise of weight independence,

Thus, their performance remains to be improved. In this paper, we propose to
optimize gradient-driven sparsity (OptG) by solving this independence paradox.
Our motive comes from the recent advances in supermask training which shows
that high-performing sparse subnetworks can be located by simply updating mask
values without modifying any weight. We prove that supermask training is to
accumulate the criteria of gradient-driven sparsity for both removed and
preserved weights, and it can partly solve the independence paradox.
Consequently, OptG integrates supermask training into gradient-driven sparsity,

target sequence. The Connectionist Temporal Classification (CTC) criterion is
widely used in multiple seq2seq tasks. Besides predicting the target sequence,
a side product of CTC is to predict the alignment, which is the most probable
input-long sequence that specifies a hard aligning relationship between the
input and target units. As there are multiple potential aligning sequences
(called paths) that are equally considered in CTC formulation, the choice of
which path will be most probable and become the predicted alignment is always
uncertain. In addition, it is usually observed that the alignment predicted by
vanilla CTC will drift compared with its reference and rarely provides
practical functionalities. Thus, the motivation of this work is to make the CTC
alignment prediction controllable and thus equip CTC with extra
functionalities. The Bayes risk CTC (BRCTC) criterion is then proposed in this
work, in which a customizable Bayes risk function is adopted to enforce the
desired characteristics of the predicted alignment. With the risk function, the
BRCTC is a general framework to adopt some customizable preference over the
paths in order to concentrate the posterior into a particular subset of the
paths. In applications, we explore one particular preference which yields
models with the down-sampling ability and reduced inference costs. By using
BRCTC with another preference for early emissions, we obtain an improved

fine-tuning and infilling, but harmful for next token prediction and zero-shot
priming). We train models with up to 6.7B parameters, and find differences to

Rather, the following procedure would allow drawing inferences about methods'
performance effects: (1) A population of processing systems that researchers
seek to infer to has to be defined. (2) A random sample of processing systems
from this population is drawn. (The drawn processing systems in the sample will
vary with regard to the methods they apply along their procedural pipelines and
also will vary regarding the compositions of their training and test data sets
used for training and evaluation.) (3) Each processing system is applied once
with method A and once with method B. (4) Based on the sample of applied
processing systems, the expected generalization errors of method A and method B
are approximated. (5) The difference between the expected generalization errors
of method A and method B is the estimated average treatment effect due to
applying method A compared to method B in the population of processing systems.",0,0,0,0,0,1,0.0257219,21.0,0.749674,21

distributions. While this can be estimated via distribution shift, we argue
that this does not directly correlate with change in the observed error of a
classifier (i.e. error-gap). Thus, we propose to use a statistic from the
theoretical domain adaptation literature which can be directly tied to
error-gap. We study the bias of this statistic as an estimator of error-gap

Medical Diagnosis (DSMD) has received much attention in recent years. Different
from early researches that needed to rely on extra human resources and
expertise to help construct the system, recent researches focused on how to
build DSMD in a purely data-driven manner. However, the previous data-driven
DSMD methods largely overlooked the system interpretability, which is critical
for a medical application, and they also suffered from the data sparsity issue
at the same time. In this paper, we explore how to bring interpretability to
data-driven DSMD. Specifically, we propose a more interpretable decision
process to implement the dialogue manager of DSMD by reasonably mimicking real
doctors' inquiry logics, and we devise a model with highly transparent
components to conduct the inference. Moreover, we collect a new DSMD dataset,
which has a much larger scale, more diverse patterns and is of higher quality
than the existing ones. The experiments show that our method obtains 7.7%,
10.0%, 3.0% absolute improvement in diagnosis accuracy respectively on three

for high visual-fidelity stylization. QuantArt pushes the latent representation
of the generated artwork toward the centroids of the real artwork distribution
with vector quantization. By fusing the quantized and continuous latent

pre-trained for object classification and thus do not capture the subtly

studies employ supervision from the linguistic space, and use pre-trained word
embeddings to better separate and compose attribute-object pairs for
recognition. Analogous to linguistic embedding space, which already has unique
and agnostic embeddings for object and attribute, we shift the focus back to
the visual space and propose a novel architecture that can disentangle
attribute and object features in the visual space. We use visual decomposed
features to hallucinate embeddings that are representative for the seen and
novel compositions to better regularize the learning of our model. Extensive

fine-tuning usually makes the model narrowly specialized on this dataset with
reduced general in-context learning performances, which is undesirable whenever
the fine-tuned model needs to handle additional tasks where no fine-tuning data

discover one important cause of such forgetting, format specialization, where
the model overfits to the format of the fine-tuned task.We further show that
format specialization happens at the very beginning of fine-tuning. To solve
this problem, we propose Prompt Tuning with MOdel Tuning (ProMoT), a simple yet
effective two-stage fine-tuning framework that reduces format specialization

additional and removable parameters by first doing prompt tuning and then
fine-tuning the model itself with this soft prompt attached. With experiments

ProMoT achieves comparable performance on fine-tuned tasks to standard
fine-tuning, but with much less loss of in-context learning performances across

AIs can surpass human performance by a large margin. Given that the state space
of Go is extremely large and a human player can play the game from any legal
state, we ask whether adversarial states exist for Go AIs that may lead them to
play surprisingly wrong actions. In this paper, we first extend the concept of
adversarial examples to the game of Go: we generate perturbed states that are
``semantically'' equivalent to the original state by adding meaningless moves
to the game, and an adversarial state is a perturbed state leading to an
undoubtedly inferior action that is obvious even for Go beginners. However,
searching the adversarial state is challenging due to the large, discrete, and
non-differentiable search space. To tackle this challenge, we develop the first
adversarial attack on Go AIs that can efficiently search for adversarial states
by strategically reducing the search space. This method can also be extended to
other board games such as NoGo. Experimentally, we show that the actions taken
by both Policy-Value neural network (PV-NN) and Monte Carlo tree search (MCTS)
can be misled by adding one or two meaningless stones; for example, on 58\% of
the AlphaGo Zero self-play games, our method can make the widely used KataGo
agent with 50 simulations of MCTS plays a losing action by adding two
meaningless stones. We additionally evaluated the adversarial examples found by
our algorithm with amateur human Go players and 90\% of examples indeed lead
the Go agent to play an obviously inferior action. Our code is available at

in the normal models, which are only activated when the model is aware of the
specific inputs (i.e., the trigger). However, despite their success in the
conventional Euclidean space, there are few studies of backdoor attacks on
graph structured data. In this paper, we propose a new type of backdoor which
is specific to graph data, called neighboring backdoor. Considering the
discreteness of graph data, how to effectively design the triggers while
retaining the model accuracy on the original task is the major challenge. To
address such a challenge, we set the trigger as a single node, and the backdoor
is activated when the trigger node is connected to the target node. To preserve
the model accuracy, the model parameters are not allowed to be modified. Thus,
when the trigger node is not connected, the model performs normally. Under
these settings, in this work, we focus on generating the features of the
trigger node. Two types of backdoors are proposed: (1) Linear Graph Convolution
Backdoor which finds an approximation solution for the feature generation (can
be viewed as an integer programming problem) by looking at the linear part of
GCNs. (2) Variants of existing graph attacks. We extend current gradient-based

are central to accountable decision making. Actual causality focuses on
specific outcomes and aims to identify decisions (actions) that were critical
in realizing an outcome of interest. Responsibility attribution is
complementary and aims to identify the extent to which decision makers (agents)
are responsible for this outcome. In this paper, we study these concepts under
a widely used framework for multi-agent sequential decision making under
uncertainty: decentralized partially observable Markov decision processes
(Dec-POMDPs). Following recent works in RL that show correspondence between
POMDPs and Structural Causal Models (SCMs), we first establish a connection
between Dec-POMDPs and SCMs. This connection enables us to utilize a language
for describing actual causality from prior work and study existing definitions
of actual causality in Dec-POMDPs. Given that some of the well-known
definitions may lead to counter-intuitive actual causes, we introduce a novel
definition that more explicitly accounts for causal dependencies between
agents' actions. We then turn to responsibility attribution based on actual
causality, where we argue that in ascribing responsibility to an agent it is
important to consider both the number of actual causes in which the agent
participates, as well as its ability to manipulate its own degree of
responsibility. Motivated by these arguments we introduce a family of
responsibility attribution methods that extends prior work, while accounting
for the aforementioned considerations. Finally, through a simulation-based

given query keyword occurs. We investigate to what extent keyword localisation
is possible using a visually grounded speech (VGS) model. VGS models are
trained on unlabelled images paired with spoken captions. These models are
therefore self-supervised -- trained without any explicit textual label or
location information. To obtain training targets, we first tag training images
with soft text labels using a pretrained visual classifier with a fixed
vocabulary. This enables a VGS model to predict the presence of a written
keyword in an utterance, but not its location. We consider four ways to equip
VGS models with localisations capabilities. Two of these -- a saliency approach
and input masking -- can be applied to an arbitrary prediction model after
training, while the other two -- attention and a score aggregation approach --
are incorporated directly into the structure of the model. Masked-based
localisation gives some of the best reported localisation scores from a VGS
model, with an accuracy of 57% when the system knows that a keyword occurs in
an utterance and need to predict its location. In a setting where localisation
is performed after detection, an $F_1$ of 25% is achieved, and in a setting
where a keyword spotting ranking pass is first performed, we get a localisation
P@10 of 32%. While these scores are modest compared to the idealised setting
with unordered bag-of-word-supervision (from transcriptions), these models do
not receive any textual or location supervision. Further analyses show that
these models are limited by the first detection or ranking pass. Moreover,
individual keyword localisation performance is correlated with the tagging
performance from the visual classifier. We also show qualitatively how and

prohibitive adaptation costs. In fact, fine-tuning all the parameters of a
colossal model and retaining separate instances for different tasks are
practically infeasible. This necessitates a new branch of research focusing on
the parameter-efficient adaptation of PLMs, dubbed as delta tuning in this
paper. In contrast with the standard fine-tuning, delta tuning only fine-tunes
a small portion of the model parameters while keeping the rest untouched,
largely reducing both the computation and storage costs. Recent studies have
demonstrated that a series of delta tuning methods with distinct tuned
parameter selection could achieve performance on a par with full-parameter
fine-tuning, suggesting a new promising way of stimulating large-scale PLMs. In
this paper, we first formally describe the problem of delta tuning and then
comprehensively review recent delta tuning approaches. We also propose a
unified categorization criterion that divide existing delta tuning methods into
three groups: addition-based, specification-based, and reparameterization-based
methods. Though initially proposed as an efficient method to steer large
models, we believe that some of the fascinating evidence discovered along with
delta tuning could help further reveal the mechanisms of PLMs and even deep
neural networks. To this end, we discuss the theoretical principles underlying
the effectiveness of delta tuning and propose frameworks to interpret delta
tuning from the perspective of optimization and optimal control, respectively.
Furthermore, we provide a holistic empirical study of representative methods,

the retrieved documents. In this paper, we present a novel perspective for
solving knowledge-intensive tasks by replacing document retrievers with large
language model generators. We call our method generate-then-read (GenRead),

since there are few consecutive sentence-level repetitions in human corpora

works have shown that these pre-trained language models encode simple
linguistic properties in their hidden representations. However, none of the
previous work assessed whether these models encode the whole grammatical
structure of a programming language. In this paper, we prove the existence of a
syntactic subspace, lying in the hidden representations of pre-trained language
models, which contain the syntactic information of the programming language. We
show that this subspace can be extracted from the models' representations and
define a novel probing method, the AST-Probe, that enables recovering the whole
abstract syntax tree (AST) of an input code snippet. In our experimentations,
we show that this syntactic subspace exists in five state-of-the-art

estimate the optimal size of this syntactic subspace and show that its
dimension is substantially lower than those of the models' representation

false negative pixels (FNs) and false positive pixels (FPs). Traditional

propose a competitive game framework (pixelGame) from a novel perspective for
ISTS. In pixelGame, FNs and FPs are controlled by different player whose goal
is to minimize their own utility function. FNs-player and FPs-player are
designed with different strategies: One is to minimize FNs and the other is to
minimize FPs. The utility function drives the evolution of the two participants

important roles in task performance. This paper introduces a new method to
co-evolve these two components in the same process. We do that by using the
hyperNEAT algorithm to generate two separate neural networks in one pass, one
responsible for the design of the robot body structure and the other for the
control of the robot.
  The key difference between our method and most existing approaches is that it
does not treat the development of the morphology and the controller as separate
processes. Similar to nature, our method derives both the ""brain"" and the
""body"" of an agent from a single genome and develops them together. While our
approach is more realistic and doesn't require an arbitrary separation of
processes during evolution, it also makes the problem more complex because the
search space for this single genome becomes larger and any mutation to the
genome affects ""brain"" and the ""body"" at the same time.
  Additionally, we present a new speciation function that takes into
consideration both the genotypic distance, as is the standard for NEAT, and the
similarity between robot bodies. By using this function, agents with very
different bodies are more likely to be in different species, this allows robots
with different morphologies to have more specialized controllers since they
won't crossover with other robots that are too different from them.
  We evaluate the presented methods on four tasks and observe that even if the
search space was larger, having a single genome makes the evolution process
converge faster when compared to having separated genomes for body and control.

regularity and controllers capable of coordinating the voxels to produce the

self-training to generate more labeled in-domain data. We create a benchmark

Instead of decades of qualitative and manual analysis of gender bias in fairy
tales, we computationally analyze gender bias in a fairy tale dataset
containing 624 fairy tales from 7 different cultures. We specifically examine
gender difference in terms of moral foundations, which are measures of human
morality, and events, which reveal human activities associated with each
character. We find that the number of male characters is two times that of
female characters, showing a disproportionate gender representation. Our
analysis further reveal stereotypical portrayals of both male and female
characters in terms of moral foundations and events. Female characters turn out
more associated with care-, loyalty- and sanctity- related moral words, while
male characters are more associated with fairness- and authority- related moral
words. Female characters' events are often about emotion (e.g., weep),
appearance (e.g., comb), household (e.g., bake), etc.; while male characters'
events are more about profession (e.g., hunt), violence (e.g., destroy),
justice (e.g., judge), etc. Gender bias in terms of moral foundations shows an

in fine-grained insights presented in form of dichotomy-style results, lower
bounds when translating to other formalisms like propositional satisfiability
(SAT), and even detailed parameterized complexity landscapes. A generic
parameter in parameterized complexity originating from graph theory is the
so-called treewidth, which in a sense captures structural density of a program.
Recently, there was an increase in the number of treewidth-based solvers
related to SAT. While there are translations from (normal) ASP to SAT, no
reduction that preserves treewidth or at least keeps track of the treewidth
increase is known. In this paper we propose a novel reduction from normal ASP
to SAT that is aware of the treewidth, and guarantees that a slight increase of
treewidth is indeed sufficient. Further, we show a new result establishing
that, when considering treewidth, already the fragment of normal ASP is
slightly harder than SAT (under reasonable assumptions in computational
complexity). This also confirms that our reduction probably cannot be
significantly improved and that the slight increase of treewidth is
unavoidable. Finally, we present an empirical study of our novel reduction from

classification task in this paper. Although there are a few related studies in
other diseases, automatic diagnosis of eye diseases exhibits unique
characteristics. First, descriptions of both eyes are mixed up in OEMR
documents, with both free text and templated asymptomatic descriptions,
resulting in sparsity and clutter of information. Second, OEMR documents
contain multiple parts of descriptions and have long document lengths. Third,
it is critical to provide explainability to the disease diagnosis model. To
overcome those challenges, we present an effective automatic eye disease
diagnosis framework, NEEDED. In this framework, a preprocessing module is
integrated to improve the density and quality of information. Then, we design a
hierarchical transformer structure for learning the contextualized
representations of each sentence in the OEMR document. For the diagnosis part,
we propose an attention-based predictor that enables traceable diagnosis by
obtaining disease-specific information. Experiments on the real dataset and

the direct effect of textual modality on the model prediction while the
indirect one is more reliable by considering multimodal semantics. Inspired by

sentiment analysis, which captures the direct effect of textual modality via an
extra text model and estimates the indirect one by a multimodal model. During
the inference, we first estimate the direct effect by the counterfactual

systems, they typically require paired text and image as input during
inference, which limits their applicability to real-world scenarios. In this
paper, we introduce a visual hallucination framework, called VALHALLA, which
requires only source sentences at inference time and instead uses hallucinated
visual representations for multimodal machine translation. In particular, given
a source sentence an autoregressive hallucination transformer is used to
predict a discrete visual representation from the input text, and the combined
text and hallucinated representations are utilized to obtain the target
translation. We train the hallucination transformer jointly with the
translation transformer using standard backpropagation with cross-entropy
losses while being guided by an additional loss that encourages consistency
between predictions using either ground-truth or hallucinated visual
representations. Extensive experiments on three standard translation datasets
with a diverse set of language pairs demonstrate the effectiveness of our
approach over both text-only baselines and state-of-the-art methods. Project

significantly mitigate the covariate shift effects; 2) matches or surpasses

valuable for planners and policy makers whose decisions can potentially impact
millions of city residents. Despite the value of understanding a city's
typology, labeled data (city and it's typology) is scarce, and spans at most a
few hundred cities in the current transportation literature. To break this

typology given the information in its Wikipedia page. Our method leverages
recent breakthroughs in natural language processing, namely sentence-BERT, and
shows how the text-based information from Wikipedia can be effectively used as
a data source for city typology prediction tasks that can be applied to over
2000 cities worldwide. We propose a novel method for low-dimensional city
representation using a city's Wikipedia page, which makes supervised learning
of city typology labels tractable even with a few hundred labeled samples.
These features are used with labeled city samples to train binary classifiers
(logistic regression) for four different city typologies: (i) congestion, (ii)
auto-heavy, (iii) transit-heavy, and (iv) bike-friendly cities resulting in
reasonably high AUC scores of 0.87, 0.86, 0.61 and 0.94 respectively. Our
approach provides sufficient flexibility for incorporating additional variables

sentence-level relation extraction (RE), but this risks leaking superficial and
spurious clues of relations. As a result, RE still suffers from unintended
entity bias, i.e., the spurious correlation between entity mentions (names) and
relations. Entity bias can mislead the RE models to extract the relations that
do not exist in the text. To combat this issue, some previous work masks the
entity mentions to prevent the RE models from overfitting entity mentions.
However, this strategy degrades the RE performance because it loses the
semantic information of entities. In this paper, we propose the CORE
(Counterfactual Analysis based Relation Extraction) debiasing method that
guides the RE models to focus on the main effects of textual context without
losing the entity information. We first construct a causal graph for RE, which
models the dependencies between variables in RE models. Then, we propose to
conduct counterfactual analysis on our causal graph to distill and mitigate the
entity bias, that captures the causal effects of specific entity mentions in
each instance. Note that our CORE method is model-agnostic to debias existing
RE systems during inference without changing their training processes.

generalizes well when there is a lack of training data. On the one hand, PAIE
utilizes prompt tuning for extractive objectives to take the best advantages of
Pre-trained Language Models (PLMs). It introduces two span selectors based on
the prompt to select start/end tokens among input texts for each role. On the
other hand, it captures argument interactions via multi-role prompts and
conducts joint optimization with optimal span assignments via a bipartite
matching loss. Also, with a flexible prompt design, PAIE can extract multiple
arguments with the same role instead of conventional heuristic threshold
tuning. We have conducted extensive experiments on three benchmarks, including
both sentence- and document-level EAE. The results present promising
improvements from PAIE (3.5\% and 2.3\% F1 gains in average on three
benchmarks, for PAIE-base and PAIE-large respectively). Further analysis

underlying temporal correlation encoded in blur. Based on multi-scale residual
Swin transformer blocks, we introduce dual-end temporal supervision and
temporally symmetric ensembling strategies to generate effective features for
time-varying motion rendering. In addition, we design a hybrid camera system to

computational models that can better explain human language evolution, the
creation of symbol systems, and the construction of internal representations.
This study provides a new model for emergent communication, which is based on a
probabilistic generative model (PGM) instead of a discriminative model based on
deep reinforcement learning. We define the Metropolis-Hastings (MH) naming game
by generalizing previously proposed models. It is not a referential game with
explicit feedback, as assumed by many emergent communication studies. Instead,
it is a game based on joint attention without explicit feedback.
Mathematically, the MH naming game is proved to be a type of MH algorithm for
an integrative PGM that combines two agents that play the naming game. From
this viewpoint, symbol emergence is regarded as decentralized Bayesian
inference, and semiotic communication is regarded as inter-personal cross-modal
inference. This notion leads to the collective predictive coding hypothesis}
regarding language evolution and, in general, the emergence of symbols. We also
propose the inter-Gaussian mixture model (GMM)+ variational autoencoder (VAE),
a deep generative model for emergent communication based on the MH naming game.
The model has been validated on MNIST and Fruits 360 datasets. Experimental
findings demonstrate that categories are formed from real images observed by
agents, and signs are correctly shared across agents by successfully utilizing
both of the observations of agents via the MH naming game. Furthermore,
scholars verified that visual images were recalled from signs uttered by

investigate are assumed to be nonexistent here. In this paper, we show that
category theory provides powerful machinery to answer this question. We have
proved three results. The first one limits the power of prompt-based learning,
saying that the model can solve a downstream task with prompts if and only if
the task is representable. The second one says fine tuning does not have this
limit, as a foundation model with the minimum required power (up to symmetry)
can theoretically solve downstream tasks for the category defined by pretext
task, with fine tuning and enough resources. Our final result can be seen as a
new type of generalization theorem, showing that the foundation model can
generate unseen objects from the target category (e.g., images) using the
structural information from the source category (e.g., texts). Along the way,
we provide a categorical framework for supervised and self-supervised learning,

This discovery has adverse implications for auditors, regulators, and other

networks have emerged as a powerful and promising tool to represent different
kinds of signals due to its continuous, differentiable properties, showing
superiorities to classical discretized representations. However, the training
of neural networks for INRs only utilizes input-output pairs, and the
derivatives of the target output with respect to the input, which can be
accessed in some cases, are usually ignored. In this paper, we propose a
training paradigm for INRs whose target output is image pixels, to encode image
derivatives in addition to image values in the neural network. Specifically, we
use finite differences to approximate image derivatives. We show how the
training paradigm can be leveraged to solve typical INRs problems, i.e., image
regression and inverse rendering, and demonstrate this training paradigm can
improve the data-efficiency and generalization capabilities of INRs. The code

Recently, several works have demonstrated high gains by taking a

By dividing the learning process into multiple stages, our framework improves
the parser's ability to acquire general SQL knowledge instead of capturing
spurious patterns, making it more generalizable and robust. Experimental

As a step towards addressing the underlying knowledge representation,

we consider an assistive robot trying to reduce clutter in any given scene by
reasoning about the occlusion of objects and stability of object configurations
in an image of the scene. In this context, our architecture incrementally

Non-monotonic logical reasoning with this information and incomplete

occlusion. For images that cannot be processed by such reasoning, regions

Classifying social texts such as fake news, rumour, sarcasm, etc. has gained
significant attention. The surface-level signals expressed by a social-text
itself may not be adequate for such tasks; therefore, recent methods attempted
to incorporate other intrinsic signals such as user behavior and the underlying
graph structure. Oftentimes, the `public wisdom' expressed through the
comments/replies to a social-text acts as a surrogate of crowd-sourced view and
may provide us with complementary signals. State-of-the-art methods on

model hyper-parameters to avoid safety violations. Here, we propose a
data-driven approach to this problem by meta-learning priors for safe BO from
offline data. We build on a meta-learning algorithm, F-PACOH, capable of
providing reliable uncertainty quantification in settings of data scarcity. As
core contribution, we develop a novel framework for choosing safety-compliant
priors in a data-riven manner via empirical uncertainty metrics and a frontier
search algorithm. On benchmark functions and a high-precision motion system, we
demonstrate that our meta-learned priors accelerate the convergence of safe BO
approaches while maintaining safety.",1,1,0,0,0,0,0.222739,10.0,0.701216,60

performance on several downstream tasks for both high-resourced and

most effective approaches to adapt to a new language is \textit{language
adaptive fine-tuning} (LAFT) -- fine-tuning a multilingual PLM on monolingual
texts of a language using the pre-training objective. However, adapting to a
target language individually takes a large disk space and limits the
cross-lingual transfer abilities of the resulting models because they have been
specialized for a single language. In this paper, we perform
\textit{multilingual adaptive fine-tuning} on 17 most-resourced African
languages and three other high-resource languages widely spoken on the African

the multilingual PLM, we removed vocabulary tokens from the embedding layer

Treating all unknown triplets as false is called the closed-world assumption.
This closed-world assumption might negatively affect the fairness and
consistency of the evaluation metrics. In this paper, we study KGC evaluation

as bias can be implicitly embedded in data. In this study, we investigate the
level of implicit race information available to ML models and human experts and
the implications of model-detectable differences in clinical notes. Our work
makes three key contributions. First, we find that models can identify patient
self-reported race from clinical notes even when the notes are stripped of
explicit indicators of race. Second, we determine that human experts are not
able to accurately predict patient race from the same redacted clinical notes.
Finally, we demonstrate the potential harm of this implicit information in a
simulation study, and show that models trained on these race-redacted clinical
notes can still perpetuate existing biases in clinical treatment decisions.",0,1,0,0,0,0,0.900684,8.0,0.903446,66

manipulate public opinion and spread misinformation. Research efforts have been
made to automatically identify bots based on texts and networks on social
media. Existing methods only leverage texts or networks alone, and while few
works explored the shallow combination of the two modalities, we hypothesize
that the interaction and information exchange between texts and graphs could be
crucial for holistically evaluating bot activities on social media. In
addition, according to a recent survey (Cresci, 2020), Twitter bots are
constantly evolving while advanced bots steal genuine users' tweets and dilute
their malicious content to evade detection. This results in greater
inconsistency across the timeline of novel Twitter bots, which warrants more
attention. In light of these challenges, we propose BIC, a Twitter Bot
detection framework with text-graph Interaction and semantic Consistency.
Specifically, in addition to separately modeling the two modalities on social
media, BIC employs a text-graph interaction module to enable information
exchange across modalities in the learning process. In addition, given the
stealing behavior of novel Twitter bots, BIC proposes to model semantic
consistency in tweets based on attention weights while using it to augment the
decision process. Extensive experiments demonstrate that BIC consistently
outperforms state-of-the-art baselines on two widely adopted datasets. Further

learning based on a memory bank is first used to train each new task so that
the model can effectively learn the relation representation. Then, contrastive
replay is conducted of the samples in memory and makes the model retain the
knowledge of historical relations through memory knowledge distillation to
prevent the catastrophic forgetting of the old task. The proposed method can

semantic representations of data that satisfy the key properties of minimalism,
generalizability, and efficiency so as to do more with less. We then explain

results suggest that the cluster structure of the underlying problem and the
non-linearity of the expert are pivotal to the success of MoE. To further
understand this, we consider a challenging classification problem with
intrinsic cluster structures, which is hard to learn using a single expert. Yet
with the MoE layer, by choosing the experts as two-layer nonlinear
convolutional neural networks (CNNs), we show that the problem can be learned
successfully. Furthermore, our theory shows that the router can learn the
cluster-center features, which helps divide the input complex problem into
simpler linear classification sub-problems that individual experts can conquer.

representation that enables effective discrimination on anomalies. However,
when contaminated with unlabeled abnormal samples in training set under
semi-supervised settings, current contrastive-based methods generally 1) ignore
the comprehensive relation between training data, leading to suboptimal

address the above two issues, in this paper, we propose a novel hierarchical

regulates three complementary relations: sample-to-sample, sample-to-prototype,

Besides, HSCL is an end-to-end learning approach that can efficiently learn
discriminative representations without fine-tuning. HSCL achieves

distributions over strings: one representing the language generator under

Mauve approximates it by measuring the divergence between multinomial
distributions over clusters instead, where cluster assignments are attained by

the optimal stopover location for MPLs throughout the day and plans
corresponding delivery routes. A Hybrid Q Learning Network based Method (HQM)

with shorter computation time than the exact approach solved by the Gurobi

HQM is 1.96 times greater than GA, which demonstrates that HQM has a better
optimisation ability. Further, we identify critical factors that contribute to
fleet size requirements, travel distances, and service delays. Our findings

pedestrians and projected to multiple views, to relieve the impact of
overfitting in the training. Moreover, the feature map of each view is
projected to multiple parallel planes at different heights, by using
homographies, which allows the CNNs to fully utilize the features across the

sentences and the post-edited sentences through a Translation Error Rate (TER)

quality to some extent, we find it usually conflicts with the human judgement

introduce Valla that standardizes and benchmarks AA/AV datasets and metrics,
provide a large-scale empirical evaluation, and provide apples-to-apples
comparisons between existing methods. We evaluate eight promising methods on
fifteen datasets (including distribution-shifted challenge sets) and introduce
a new large-scale dataset based on texts archived by Project Gutenberg.
Surprisingly, we find that a traditional Ngram-based model performs best on 5
(of 7) AA tasks, achieving an average macro-accuracy of $76.50\%$ (compared to
$66.71\%$ for a BERT-based model). However, on the two AA datasets with the
greatest number of words per author, as well as on the AV datasets, BERT-based
models perform best. While AV methods are easily applied to AA, they are seldom
included as baselines in AA papers. We show that through the application of
hard-negative mining, AV methods are competitive alternatives to AA methods.

quantization of 2D optical flow with only four discrete motion directions.
Conditioned on the motion guidance, the blur decomposition is led to a

(2) a Domain Query Attention based module (DQA) is employed to adaptively
reduce the inconsistency; (3) a Codebook-based Space Compress module (CSC) that

in a wide range of NLP tasks. However, fine-tuning the whole model is parameter
inefficient as it always yields an entirely new model for each task. Currently,
many research works propose to only fine-tune a small portion of the parameters
while keeping most of the parameters shared across different tasks. These
methods achieve surprisingly good performance and are shown to be more stable
than their corresponding fully fine-tuned counterparts. However, such kind of
methods is still not well understood. Some natural questions arise: How does
the parameter sparsity lead to promising performance? Why is the model more
stable than the fully fine-tuned models? How to choose the tunable parameters?
In this paper, we first categorize the existing methods into random approaches,
rule-based approaches, and projection-based approaches based on how they choose
which parameters to tune. Then, we show that all of the methods are actually
sparse fine-tuned models and conduct a novel theoretical analysis of them. We
indicate that the sparsity is actually imposing a regularization on the
original model by controlling the upper bound of the stability. Such stability
leads to better generalization capability which has been empirically observed
in a lot of recent research works. Despite the effectiveness of sparsity
grounded by our theory, it still remains an open problem of how to choose the
tunable parameters. To better choose the tunable parameters, we propose a novel

determined by directly optimizing the approximation function. The experimental

coresets in this domain were either data-dependent or generated under
restrictive assumptions on both the model's weights and inputs. In real-world

achieved by a combination of L\""{o}wner ellipsoid and Caratheodory theorem. Our

stepwise generation can better exploit the compositionality and generalize to
longer proofs but has achieved limited success on real-world data. Existing
stepwise methods struggle to generate proof steps that are both logically valid

given the hypothesis. In this paper, we present a novel stepwise method,
NLProofS (Natural Language Proof Search), which learns to generate relevant

independent verifier to check the validity of the proof steps to prevent
hallucination. Instead of generating steps greedily, we search for proofs
maximizing a global proof score judged by the verifier. NLProofS achieves

that they still hallucinate frequently, and models achieving better scores on
standard metrics (e.g., CIDEr) could be more unfaithful. Second, we investigate
how different types of image encoding in VLP influence hallucination, including

work, we examine the open question of social intelligence and Theory of Mind in
modern NLP systems from an empirical and theory-based perspective. We show that
one of today's largest language models (GPT-3; Brown et al., 2020) lacks this

enabling various real-world applications. However, the lack of effective
vision-based algorithms has been a stumbling block to achieving this goal.
Existing systems often require hand-engineered components for state estimation,
planning, and control. Such a sequential design involves laborious tuning,
human heuristics, and compounding delays and errors. This paper tackles the
vision-based autonomous-drone-racing problem by learning deep sensorimotor
policies. We use contrastive learning to extract robust feature representations
from the input images and leverage a two-stage learning-by-cheating framework
for training a neural network policy. The resulting policy directly infers
control commands with feature representations learned from raw images, forgoing
the need for globally-consistent state estimation, trajectory planning, and
handcrafted control design. Our experimental results indicate that our
vision-based policy can achieve the same level of racing performance as the
state-based policy while being robust against different visual disturbances and
distractors. We believe this work serves as a stepping-stone toward developing
intelligent vision-based autonomous systems that control the drone purely from
image inputs, like human pilots.",0,1,0,0,0,0,0.959403,6.0,0.92583,47

frame of a video. A good streaming recognition model captures both long-term
dynamics and short-term changes of video. Unfortunately, in most existing
methods, the computational complexity grows linearly or quadratically with the
length of the considered dynamics. This issue is particularly pronounced in
transformer-based architectures. To address this issue, we reformulate the
cross-attention in a video transformer through the lens of kernel and apply two
kinds of temporal smoothing kernel: A box kernel or a Laplace kernel. The
resulting streaming attention reuses much of the computation from frame to
frame, and only requires a constant time update each frame. Based on this idea,
we build TeSTra, a Temporal Smoothing Transformer, that takes in arbitrarily
long inputs with constant caching and computing overhead. Specifically, it runs
$6\times$ faster than equivalent sliding-window based transformers with 2,048
frames in a streaming setting. Furthermore, thanks to the increased temporal
span, TeSTra achieves state-of-the-art results on THUMOS'14 and

learning (MADRL)-based method for solving the joint virtual network function
(VNF) placement and routing (P&R), where multiple service requests with
differentiated demands are delivered at the same time. The differentiated
demands of the service requests are reflected by their delay- and
cost-sensitive factors. We first construct a VNF P&R problem to jointly
minimize a weighted sum of service delay and resource consumption cost, which
is NP-complete. Then, the joint VNF P&R problem is decoupled into two iterative
subtasks: placement subtask and routing subtask. Each subtask consists of
multiple concurrent parallel sequential decision processes. By invoking the
deep deterministic policy gradient method and multi-agent technique, an
MADRL-P&R framework is designed to perform the two subtasks. The new joint
reward and internal rewards mechanism is proposed to match the goals and

advances in neural rendering. However, 3D-aware synthesis of face dynamics
hasn't received much attention. Here, we study how to explicitly control
generative model synthesis of face dynamics exhibiting non-rigid motion (e.g.,
facial expression change), while simultaneously ensuring 3D-awareness. For this
we propose a Controllable Radiance Field (CoRF): 1) Motion control is achieved
by embedding motion features within the layered latent motion space of a
style-based generator; 2) To ensure consistency of background, motion features
and subject-specific attributes such as lighting, texture, shapes, albedo, and
identity, a face parsing net, a head regressor and an identity encoder are
incorporated. On head image/video data we show that CoRFs are 3D-aware while
enabling editing of identity, viewing directions, and motion.",0,0,0,0,0,0,0.9132,8.0,0.910532,77

pre-training approach for the task of object detection. This approach is
motivated by the two key factors in detection: localization and recognition.
While accurate localization favors models that operate at the pixel- or
point-level, correct recognition typically relies on a more holistic,
region-level view of objects. Incorporating this perspective in pre-training,
our approach performs contrastive learning by directly sampling individual
point pairs from different regions. Compared to an aggregated representation
per region, our approach is more robust to the change in input region quality,
and further enables us to implicitly improve initial region assignments via
online knowledge distillation during training. Both advantages are important
when dealing with imperfect regions encountered in the unsupervised setting.
Experiments show point-level region contrast improves on state-of-the-art
pre-training methods for object detection and segmentation across multiple
tasks and datasets, and we provide extensive ablation studies and
visualizations to aid understanding. Code will be made available.",0,1,0,0,1,0,0.93012,5.0,0.873851,52

work side by side or even hand in hand with humans to balance each other's
limitations. Such cooperative interactions are ever more sophisticated. Thus,
the ability to reason not just about a human's center of gravity position, but
also its granular motion is an important prerequisite for human-robot
interaction. Though, many algorithms ignore the multimodal nature of humans or
neglect uncertainty in their motion forecasts. We present Motron, a multimodal,
probabilistic, graph-structured model, that captures human's multimodality
using probabilistic methods while being able to output deterministic
maximum-likelihood motions and corresponding confidence values for each mode.
Our model aims to be tightly integrated with the robotic
planning-control-interaction loop; outputting physically feasible human motions
and being computationally efficient. We demonstrate the performance of our
model on several challenging real-world motion forecasting datasets,
outperforming a wide array of generative/variational methods while providing
state-of-the-art single-output motions if required. Both using significantly

different emotions. We then incorporate our formulation into a
sequence-to-sequence emotional text-to-speech framework. During the training,
the framework does not only explicitly characterize emotion styles, but also
explores the ordinal nature of emotions by quantifying the differences with
other emotions. At run-time, we control the model to produce the desired
emotion mixture by manually defining an emotion attribute vector. The objective

impressive results in language modeling and machine translation, due to their
ability to retrieve fine-grained information from a datastore of examples. One
of the most prominent approaches, $k$NN-MT, exhibits strong domain adaptation
capabilities by retrieving tokens from domain-specific datastores
\citep{khandelwal2020nearest}. However, $k$NN-MT requires an expensive
retrieval operation for every single generated token, leading to a very low
decoding speed (around 8 times slower than a parametric model). In this paper,
we introduce a \textit{chunk-based} $k$NN-MT model which retrieves chunks of
tokens from the datastore, instead of a single token. We propose several
strategies for incorporating the retrieved chunks into the generation process,
and for selecting the steps at which the model needs to search for neighbors in
the datastore. Experiments on machine translation in two settings, static and
``on-the-fly'' domain adaptation, show that the chunk-based $k$NN-MT model
leads to significant speed-ups (up to 4 times) with only a small drop in

financial markets and social media jargon, which makes it a challenging task
for human raters. The resulting lack of high-quality labeled data stands in the
way of conventional supervised learning methods. Instead, we approach this
problem using semi-supervised learning with a large language model (LLM). Our
pipeline generates weak financial sentiment labels for Reddit posts with an LLM
and then uses that data to train a small model that can be served in
production. We find that prompting the LLM to produce Chain-of-Thought
summaries and forcing it through several reasoning paths helps generate more
stable and accurate labels, while using a regression loss further improves
distillation quality. With only a handful of prompts, the final model performs
on par with existing supervised models. Though production applications of our
model are limited by ethical considerations, the model's competitive
performance points to the great potential of using LLMs for tasks that
